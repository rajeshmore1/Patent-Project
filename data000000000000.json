85 \u00b0 f . steel cut oats are well known in the industry as oat particulates produced by cutting whole groats from clean , sound oats without rolling . a preferred form of steel cut oat is commercially known as a &# 34 ; table steel cut oat groat &# 34 ;. a desirable granulation size is about 8 % by weight maximum over a u . s . # 7 sieve and 25 % maximum through a u . s . # 12 sieve . steel cut oats are used in the invention to add texture to the resulting food product . to the soaking steel cut oats can be added an optional flavor fraction . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . oat bran is preferably added to the hydrating steel cut oats after the cut oats have been soaking for about 7 to 12 minutes . oat bran is water soluble and should be added in such a manner as to avoid clumping . mild agitation is preferred to break up any clumps that may have formed yet avoid harm to the added oat bran . it is not desirable to have a high rate of agitation as the oat bran will break up and solubilize to the detriment of the resulting flavor . any coarseness or granulation of oat bran can be used depending on the taste and texture desired in the final product . a preferred granulation has 10 % maximum on u . s . # 10 , 55 - 75 % on u . s . # 20 , 10 - 30 % on u . s . # 30 , and 10 % maximum in the pan at an overall density of about 30 - 32 lb / cu . ft . when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture is desirably transferred to a holding reservoir . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) can be added at any point in the process before cooking the mixture . desirably , they are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the holding reservoir . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . the oat mixture containing cut oats , bran , and flakes is then heated to a temperature of about 250 \u00b0 to 325 \u00b0 f . for a time sufficient to cook the oatmeal fractions , e . g . for 15 seconds to about 2 minutes , depending on the temperature . it is preferable to maintain aseptic conditions during the cooking and avoid the introduction of any microorganisms or bacteria which could adversely affect the food product . for that reason , conventional aseptic processing equipment such as closed kettles and heating tubes are desirably used . this aseptic product has a shelf like under refrigeration at 40 \u00b0- 50 \u00b0 f . of about 4 - 6 months . if the storage conditions of the aseptically packaged product are likely to be at temperatures above 75 \u00b0 f . for an extended period of time , it may be desirable to add a small quantity of preservative to ensure the safety of the food composition . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . further , where aseptic packaging conditions are not used , conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in the retort preparation , the steel cut oats and oat bran mixture is heated to a temperature of about 150 \u00b0 f . to about 220 \u00b0 f ., preferably at least 180 \u00b0 f . the rolled oats are then added , and the entire mixture is simmered for about 2 to 5 minutes . preferably , the mixture is simmered for about 3 minutes . the mixture is subsequently placed into containers such as bowls or pouches designed as retail or wholesale packaging for the product and additionally cooked for a time sufficient to produce an edible composition . cooking time in the containers is affected by container size and thickness , with larger and / or denser containers requiring longer cooking times . preferred cooking time in containers is about 13 minutes to 1 hour and 25 minutes . preferred cooking temperature is at least about 250 \u00b0 f ., more preferably 250 \u00b0 to about 310 \u00b0 f . further , rotation of the container may be performed , which rotation further shortens cooking time . rotation of the containers of up to 15 rpm may be used . flavorings may be added , as discussed above . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . when cooking is complete , the containers are sealed and may be heated to sanitize the contents . alternatively , conventional preservatives may be added . in both the optional aseptic and retort processes above , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the steps discussed above represents the preferred methods of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be cooked separately , combined with previously hydrated oat bran , and then cooked with rolled oats for a short time . in the &# 34 ; hot fill &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; fresh pack &# 34 ; processes , when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture may be transferred to a holding reservoir or cooking apparatus , e . g ., an open kettle . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the cooking apparatus . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir , where a reservoir is used , to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . in both the hot - fill and fresh pack processes , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the processing steps discussed below represents the preferred method of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be first hydrated , combined with the oat bran , and then cooked , with subsequent addition of rolled oats and optionally further cooking for a short time . in a preferred embodiment of the fresh pack process , the steel cut oats and water are cooked at a rolling boil for about 5 to 15 minutes , preferably about 10 minutes , at about 15 - 18 psi . the rolled oats are then added and the mixture is cooked for an additional approximately 3 to 8 minutes . the oat bran is then added and cooking is continued for up to about 3 minutes . preferably , the bran is previously hydrated to shorten cooking time , e . g ., soaked for about 1 to 5 minutes in hot water . the mixture is then transferred to containers , e . g ., through a pump system and chilled to about 40 \u00b0 to 85 \u00b0 f ., preferably to approximately 50 \u00b0 to 80 \u00b0 f . the container and oatmeal may be cooled using a variety of conventional container cooling techniques , e . g ., contact with cold water or gas , refrigeration , etc . depending on the desired end use of the product , the containers may be large pails for food service applications or retail packs for consumer use . where such packaging is not sterile , preservatives are added , generally to the cooking apparatus during processing . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . these and other conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in a preferred embodiment of the hot fill technique , the oatmeal composition can be acidified with suitable ph modifier using an open kettle for the cooking . suitable ph modifiers include glucono delta lactone , apple butter , apple pectin , any naturally acidic flavorings , and combinations thereof . the resulting product can then be filled into containers at an elevated temperature , e . g ., about 140 \u00b0 to 160 \u00b0 f ., sealed with a removable plastic film , and inverted . preferably , the container is hot filled with about 80 - 98 vol . % oatmeal with the remainder being air that is naturally drawn into the container during the filling step and becomes heated to the oatmeal temperature . an inversion step permits hot air within the container to rise through the oatmeal composition and kill any bacteria that might have been introduced as a result of the open kettle cooking . the result of the inversion is a sterile package . the hot fill product according to the invention has a refrigerated shelf life of approximately 4 - 6 months for a 24 ounce container . the product can be opened and heated on a conventional stove or in a microwave oven set at high for about 45 to 90 seconds depending on the oven power . additional flavoring agents may be added to the cooked product if desired . in either process , an optional flavor fraction may be added during processing , preferably to the steel cut oats . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . without further elaboration , it is believed that one skilled in the art can , using the preceding description , utilize the present invention to its fullest extent . the following preferred specific embodiments are , therefore , to be construed as merely illustrative , and not limitative , of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever . the entire texts of all applications , patents and publications , if any , cited above and below , are hereby incorporated by reference . table 1______________________________________ingredient wt . % ______________________________________water 73 . 9steel cut oat groats 8 . 0thick rolled oats 8 . 0wildflower honey 8 . 0oat bran 0 . 76mccormick vanilla extract ( v -

{"publication_number": "US-4406827-A", "abstract": "a cohesive nonsticky electrically conductive gel is disclosed , for facilitating low resistance contact between a metal electrode and a biological body . the gel comprises an aqueous solution of up to saturated concentrations of ionized salts as the conducting agent , a natural gum capable of crosslinking , and a crosslinking material which provides the electrically conductive gel with sufficient internal strength to remain cohesive without reinforcement . the gel has good electrical characteristics and improved physical properties which prevent the gel from leaving a messy residue on the skin of the patient or on the electrode .", "application_number": "US-7223079-A", "description": "the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar \u00ae hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e ., high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar \u00ae cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar \u00ae c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g ., the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g ., temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc ., a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g ., methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar \u00ae hp -

3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention ."}

or they may be discontinuous , such as one made of strips of material to form a loose mesh - like structure . \u201c pets \u201d refers generally to a domesticated or tamed animal kept for companionship or pleasure and treated with care and affection . dogs and cats are the most common , but certainly not the only , types of \u201c pets \u201d amenable to this invention . primates , pigs , goats , sheep , birds , lemurs , ferrets and other types of animals have also been reported as pets , and this list is still not exhaustive . although the description may refer to the more typical pets , it will be understood that the invention is broadly applicable to any animal , domesticated or not , that has a head and mouth . \u201c handlers \u201d refers to anyone who is responsible for moving , transporting , or manipulating the pet in any way . this explicitly includes owners and family members of owners ; caregivers such as veterinarians , veterinary dentists , groomers , trainers , instructors , kennel operators , zoo personnel , etc . ; and implicitly includes any other party meeting the general definition . referring to fig3 , the head or nose of an animal is referred to anatomically as the anterior end and the tail is referred to as the posterior ( sometimes caudal ) end . in organisms , that have distinct heads ( such as cats , dogs , birds , primates , and most other vertebrates ) the anterior end is sometimes referred to as the rostral or cranial end . while \u201c anterior \u201d/\u201c posterior \u201d has broader applicability for all animals , applicant prefers rostral ( for nose or beak ) and caudal ( tail ) as directional terms . this is consistent with nomina anatomica veterinaria , and with common usage in veterinary medicine . moreover , given that the invention relates to headgear , cranial might be confusing . of course , dorsal / ventral , medial / lateral , proximate / distal and other anatomical terms may also be used in the description . unless defined otherwise , all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs . although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention , the preferred methods and materials are described herein . all references cited herein , including books , journal articles , published u . s . or foreign patent applications , issued u . s . or foreign patents , and any other references , are each incorporated by reference in their entireties , including all data , tables , figures , and text presented in the cited references . numerical ranges , measurements and parameters used to characterize the invention \u2014 for example , angular degrees , quantities of ingredients , polymer molecular weights , reaction conditions ( ph , temperatures , charge levels , etc . ), physical dimensions and so forth \u2014 are necessarily approximations ; and , while reported as precisely as possible , they inherently contain imprecision derived from their respective measurements . consequently , all numbers expressing ranges of magnitudes as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201c about .\u201d all numerical ranges are understood to include all possible incremental sub - ranges within the outer boundaries of the range . thus , a range of 30 to 90 units discloses , for example , 35 to 50 units , 45 to 85 units , and 40 to 80 units , etc . unless otherwise defined , percentages are wt / wt %. referring first to fig1 a - 1c and fig4 , one embodiment of the headgear 10 is illustrated showing the \u201c clamshell \u201d nature of the head gear 10 , having two portions 10 a and 10 b , joined at a hinge area 12 . throughout this description a reference numeral , ( e . g . 6 ) may have a suffix \u201c a \u201d ( e . g . 6 a ) for a right - side part , and a suffix \u201c b \u201d ( e . g . 6 b ) for a corresponding or complementary left - side part , relative to the animal . fig1 a shows only the right half portion 10 a in top and bottom views ; while fig1 b shows only the right half portion 10 a in rostral ( front ) and caudal ( rear ) views . each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b define a periphery 11 a , 11 b that is complementary to periphery of the other side , and are cup - like or arcuate defining a cavity 13 for enclosing a spherical - like head . at a caudal area 19 of the periphery 11 ( near the hinge area 12 in this embodiment ), each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b also define semicircular recesses 14 a and 14 b that together form a generally circular opening to accommodate the neck of the animal . at the apex of a rostral end 21 , there may be one or more openings 17 to admit air and or light to the interior cavity 13 . the embodiment of the headgear 10 illustrated in fig1 a to 1c may be solid , but preferably transparent . near the rostral end 21 of the clamshell headgear 10 is a fastening mechanism such as latch 16 , which typically comprises a first portion 16 a on half 10 a , and a complementary portion 16 b located on half 10 b . the fastening mechanism may comprise one or more latches that hold the headgear closed securely about the head . generally at least one latch is in a rostral area opposing the hinge area . as shown in fig1 e to 1g in particular , the latch 16 is generally opposite from the hinge 12 . alternative locations for fastening mechanisms that may still oppose the hinge area include the ventral neck area below the jaw and / or forehead area near the eyes . other fastening mechanisms are described below . a pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) 40 may optionally be incorporated at or near the rostral end 21 of the headgear 10 . these also are described below . also shown in this embodiment in fig4 is a ring 18 or other attachment point for a leash . the ring 18 may appear on one or both halves 10 a , 10 b of the clamshell headgear 10 . referring now to fig1 d to 1g , an embodiment is illustrated wherein the device may be solid and not transparent , but includes orifices 20 a , 20 b for ears , orifices 22 a , 22 b for eyes , and orifice 17 or slots 24 a , 24 b for mouth / nose or other ventilation . in this way the pet can see externally . in other variations , the slots may also be replaced with a single extended opening ( as shown in fig5 a ) so that the handler can better see into the pet &# 39 ; s mouth . the ear orifices 20 also permit the headgear 10 to be smaller and lighter and fit closely to the head of the animal for a more secure , tighter fit . especially in closely - fitted headgear , it may be desirable to provide cushioning or padding 26 a , 26 b in areas of the device that might rub on parts of the animal &# 39 ; s head , causing irritation . headgear that closely fits the head will have skull - following contours either molded into the device or as a result of selective padding in the interior of the headgear . a second embodiment is illustrated in fig2 a to 2c . in this embodiment , the headgear 30 is composed of two halves 30 a , 30 b fabricated as a loose mesh material of criss - crossing bands that also allow for visibility and breathing . higher strength , thicker sagittal bands 52 a and 52 b form the periphery of each clamshell half along a mid - sagittal plane . similar wider or reinforced coronal bands 52 a , and 54 b may be used in a coronal plane to provide a more rigid clamshell shape . the remainder of the headgear 30 is formed of either solid material like front wall 60 , or the intermediate bands 56 that form a loose mesh or a combination of these . the headgear 30 includes a hinge area 32 , typically at a caudal end 39 opposing the rostral end 41 , and semicircular recesses 34 a , 34 b that form the neck opening . in some embodiments , headgear 30 may include fenestrations , openings , or orifices 41 a , 41 b for ears , orifices 42 a , 42 b for eyes , and orifices for mouth as well ( not shown in fig2 a - 2c ). however , unless otherwise indicated , both the solid headgear 10 and the mesh or open headgear 30 may have similar features and advantages and will be described together . the clamshell half portions may be sized in various dimensions to define a cavity 13 and orifices that accommodate the varied nose size and head shapes of pets of different genus , species , or breeds . for example a large size cup is required to encase breeds such as great danes , newfoundlands or st . bernards ; while much smaller cup portions are required for smaller breeds such as chihuahuas , shih - tzus , and many \u2018 miniature \u2019 breeds . a special version may be devised for pugs , as they have almost no rostral protrusion . similarly , cats and pets of other species will require headgear halves proportioned for their respective noses . fig5 - 6 further illustrate embodiments for different species . referring to fig1 and 4 , the clamshell headgear comprises two half - shell portions that are hinged or fastened together . the hinge area 32 may be reinforced with thicker or wider sections as best shown in fig2 a and 2b . the hinge may comprise a \u201c living \u201d hinge as is well known in the injection molding arts , and the halves can easily be molded as one unit . alternatively the hinge may be fabric , as shown in fig1 g , or other material . in some embodiments , the hinge may be located rostrally . these embodiments are generally positioned on the pet &# 39 ; s head from and anterior perspective . embodiments that have a hinge along a top or superior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from a superior approach ; embodiments that have a hinge along a lower or inferior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from below , using an inferior approach ; and embodiments that have a hinge along a lateral aspect of the head gear would be put on using a right or left lateral approach . in a more preferred variation , the hinge is located at a caudal part of the headgear , allowing an approach posteriorly . as noted , this is advantageous in that the pet will not see the device approaching and will not enter the anxiety and resistance modes so quickly . at the aspect of the clamshell headgear opposing the hinge is a fastener or latch mechanism . the fastener or latch may comprise any type of device suited for securing the two clamshell halves together about the pet &# 39 ; s head . illustrative types of fasteners include buckles ( e . g . quick release , side release , and conventional ), snaps , hook - and - loop fasteners ( such as velcro \u2122 brand ), resilient clips or tabs with detents that may insert under opposing clips , tabs or slots , or other securing mechanism may be used to secure the two halves together . as best shown in fig2 c near the rostral end 41 , the sagittal band area may be reinforced with thicker or wider band sections or a solid portion to accommodate a fastening mechanism . alternatively , the latch may be located at a rostral end or simply at the ventral side of the neck , relying on the size of the neck relative to the base of the skull to secure the device . while right and left halves that part along a sagittal plane are depicted in fig1 and 2 , it will be understood that the halves may also part along a transverse plane , producing top and bottom halves instead of right and left halves . in the case of transverse plane top and bottom halves , the hinge and fastener are located on opposite lateral sides of the headgear , and the headgear is brought near to the animal &# 39 ; s head from the side containing the hinge . fig5 a and 5b show an alternative embodiments of the headgear 110 , 210 in a closed position about the head h of an animal such as a cat . the hinge area 112 lies at a caudal position . in the embodiment of fig5 a , and there are openings 120 , 122 and 124 to allow access to the animal &# 39 ; s ears , eyes and nose / mouth , respectively . these openings allow a handler access for examining , treating , feeding , dosing medication or other necessary activity associated with the ears , eyes and nose / mouth of the animal . recess 14 a is shown for the animal &# 39 ; s neck . in phantom , a variation is shown having an elongated neck or collar portion 128 if there is a need or desire to restrict flexion of the neck . latch 116 is shown along the ventral side of the neck , although it could alternatively be anywhere under the chin area up to the rostral tip . a psz 40 for taste or smell sensations may be located between the eye opening 120 and the nose / mouth opening 124 at the rostral end . the openings 122 , 124 over the eyes and nose / mouth may be completely open , or they may have solid inserts ( not shown ) with air perforations for breathing and / or made of transparent material for sight , or opaque material if the animal tends to be calmed by less visual stimulation . in the embodiment of fig5 b , the headgear 210 is of a mesh construction similar to the embodiment of fig2 a - 2c , and having recesses 234 to define a neck opening , a fastening latch mechanism 216 , and web or band members such as 256 . a psz may or may not be present . although the animal shown in fig5 a and 5b is a cat , this same type of headgear could also be used on a dog or other animal , with only minimal modifications to size the headgear to closely fit the animals head ; for example elongating the headgear in a caudal - rostral dimension for a dog having a longer jaw and nose area , or adjusting the locations of ear and / or eye openings to be suitable for the dog or other animal . fig6 illustrates another embodiment of the headgear 310 in a closed position about the head h of a dog . the halves of the clamshell are again hinged at a caudal location 312 . the neck or collar portion 328 is shown in a moderately extended position , but may extend even further if desired to minimize or prevent neck flexion as shown in phantom . there is little coronal aspect to this embodiment . the head and eyes are relatively free . however , there is a rostral portion 330 that is fairly lengthened in order to prevent bites . latch 316 and leash attachment 318 are also shown in this embodiment . in some embodiments , the headgear device can act as a base for attachment of novelty headgear such as reindeer ears , bunny ears , baseball caps , sun shades , rain gear , etc . it can also act as an attachment point for halloween type masks and costumes . in some cases , the headgear , with or without other attachments can help promote wound healing by restricting the animal &# 39 ; s ability to lick or bite at the wounded area . in this sense , it can act like the well - known \u201c elizabethan collar \u201d restraints but is infinitely more comfortable and tolerable than the traditional cone of shame collars in present use . in use , the headgear is easily placed about the pet &# 39 ; s head and secured . in psz embodiments , the psz may be preloaded with an appropriate stimulus for the particular pet as discussed above . alternatively , the headgear may be fitted first , and the stimulus is loaded into the headgear in situ . the location of the hinge generally dictates the direction of approach to the pet . since the fastener is on an opposite side as the hinge , the clamshell opening is with the latch and that side must be brought towards the pet first . this is why the caudal hinge location is a preferred embodiment \u2014 it allows the handler to fit the headgear posteriorly , from behind the pet . the handler then biases or presses the clamshell halves closed about the head . for sagittal plane ( right and left halves ) the bias is towards a medial direction to the mid - sagittal plane ; while for coronal plane embodiments , the bias is from a ventral and dorsal extreme toward the midline . the biasing force is easily delivered by the handler &# 39 ; s hands . another advantage of the caudal hinge embodiment is that the hands and arms of the handler doing the biasing remain behind the animal , relatively safe from bites or scratches . once closed , the fastener of the headgear is secured , clamping the two halves together . the device allows restraint for such procedures as examination , venipuncture , pedicures , bathing , and grooming . in other uses , the device is useful for socializing and training an animal . in some situations , and aggressor animal may need to be restrained to prevent it from harming another anima . thus the invention includes a method to mitigate injury from interspecific and intraspecific interactions such as aggression between two dogs or two cats , or a cat and a dog . this can allow training and socialization in situations in which the aggressor could not be trusted with the non aggressor , or to prevent escalation of aggression between animals . a leading cause of death for dogs under the age of 3 is due to poor socialization which results in fear and associated aggression . a critical socialization period for dogs is between 3 weeks and 3 months of age . animals not well socialized during this time can become more fearful and aggressive when they encounter new dogs , new people , unfamiliar situations that interfere with appropriate socialization later . the headgear can protect people and other animals during these interactions so that the animal can learn appropriate behavior . it can also mitigate dangerous behavior and allow the animal to coexist . the clamshell headgear material will be lightweight , durable , and somewhat flexible . it will also need to be fairly strong and tactile so that the handler has no issues manipulating or maneuvering the animal . a couple of potential materials are mesh wire coated in plastic , or a synthetic plastic that would be injection molded . an animal will react negatively towards the headgear if it is any way uncomfortable for them , so , along with custom sizing , this design is made from a lightweight material so it is almost weightless for the animal wearing it . color : the color of this product can vary greatly . there will be different options for purchase such as a deluxe model and a standard model . in the deluxe model there could be any color produced and for the standard they may only be a few colors offered . not every animal will have the same size or shape of the head . the \u201c clamshell \u201d headgear will come in a variety of sizes and offer a superior fit than any other product on the market . this custom sizing ensures that the headgear will not be removed during use and will be comfortable for the animal . in some embodiments , inside of the headgear there is optionally another layer of security and comfort added . a soft wrap or padding may be employed in animals needing only limited restriction . by utilizing technology similar to that of an air cast one can reproduce a \u201c hug \u201d effect on the animal . this serves to reduce stress and calms the animal , making the restraint more acceptable , which is important for fractious animals and reduces the need for repeated sedations . the headgear preferably has openings for access to the ears , eyes , and the mouth . this is extremely important in veterinary and veterinary dental settings where the animal may need to have routine examinations and / or medicine applied to these areas . use of the device facilitates and aids in administration of oral treatments and medications ; dental treatment and medications ; ophthalmic treatments and medications ; and ear treatments and medications . grips : properly positioned grips are preferably built - in to the headgear to allow for safe manipulation of the animal &# 39 ; s head without risk of injury . this is especially important for medical treatment caregivers , when blood needs to be drawn from the animal . ear clamp : the implementation of an ear clamp will serve two main purposes . the first is to secure the ear during procedures and examinations , and the second is to get a pulse rate from the animal to know when dangerous levels are being approached . this is added security for the handler and the patient . plastic cover : a plastic cover or \u201c overshell \u201d that goes around the \u201c clamshell \u201d headgear will be developed as well so once the headgear is applied , the animal can be isolated within it . this case can serve as an oxygen mask and also a way of anesthetizing the patient . oral speculum : an oral speculum is another feature that could be added to the headgear . this speculum would hold the mouth open during examinations and procedures reducing the risk of a bite . fixation and venipuncture : a feature of the headgear is that it allows the head and neck area to be immobilized , particularly if the neck collar extension 128 is employed . this may be useful in treating neck injuries . in addition , with or without the collar extension , a jugular venipuncture is more easily accomplished to draw blood samples if the head and neck are immobilized through use of the headgear device . sensors & amp ; indicators : the headgear may be fitted with sensors and indicators that provide useful information about the animal &# 39 ; s biological or physiologic status . it may include lights that vary in color or number ( e . g . red , yellow , green ) to indicate dangerous or safe conditions . such sensors may also be useful in a positive reinforcement feedback loop that operates to release the pleasant stimulus in response to sensors that detect a calm and relaxed physiologic state , so as to reinforce this desired behavior . this feature is particularly useful for training purposes . as noted above , a key aspect of the invention is the pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) or module that is designed specially to appease the pet and reduce the anxiety and stress caused by strange handlers , strange environments , and foreign smells sounds and sights , and strange , unusual and sometimes uncomfortable manipulations or procedures . the psz is designed to pleasurably stimulate any of the pet &# 39 ; s senses , specifically one or more of the senses of : vision / sight , olfactory / smell , auditory / sound , taste , and tactile / touch . the psz may be incorporated as a module or portion of the headgear that facilitates the delivery of a pleasant sensory stimulus to the proper area of the pet receptors for receiving that stimulus . for example , as discussed below , pheromones or flavors might be includes in a psz near the pet &# 39 ; s nostrils at a rostral end of the headgear . similarly , a tactile psz might be included along a portion of the headgear adjacent a ventral neck or chin area or a dorsal nape of the neck area ; while an auditory stimulus would be included near the ear ( s ). a flavor port located at a rostral portion near the mouth would provide a host of benefits for the handler . this allows for easy distraction of the animal during procedures , helps habituate them to the headgear through positive reinforcement , and reduces stress . for dogs , this might include peanut butter , bacon or other treat . for cats , tuna , catnip or chicken might be preferred . this port may stimulate gustatory receptors , olfactory receptors , or both . a specific embodiment of a flavor port type of psz 40 is illustrated in cross - section in fig2 d . in the clamshell portion near the rostral aspect , the wall 60 forms an opening 62 through which a wafer or disk 64 of candy or other treat may be exposed and smelled or licked by the animal . extension wall 66 extends outwardly and around the disk or wafer 64 to form a pocket between the wall 60 and extension wall 66 . at one end or top of the pocket an extension wall may be eliminated to allow the handler to slide the wafer or disk 66 into the pocket from outside the headgear to provide the stimulus for the animal . flanges 68 of wall 60 extend beyond the limit of extension walls 66 to hold the wafer or disk 64 in the pocket so it cannot immediately be eaten by the animal . an alternative flavor port takes the form of a treat dispenser that , upon activation , dispenses a candy or other treat though an opening into the cavity 13 for the animal to eat . the pez candy dispenser loaded with animal treats is a suitable mechanism that could be used in for this type of flavor port . to help make the headgear more attractive for the animal the use of pheromones could be applied as an olfactory stimulus . by infusing the headgear with specific pheromones in a psz area near the nostrils , it will reduce the stress levels for the animal , and have a calming effect . the pet may actually learn to enjoy wearing the device , and it may in turn be used more frequently and with ease . olfactory stimuli such as pheromones could be delivered using a pocket - like structure described above having a scent infused wafer , but having a perforated barrier in wall 60 rather than a complete opening . this would allow the scent to permeate the perforated barrier while preventing the animal from eating the wafer . pleasing sounds , such as \u201c white noise \u201d generators may have a calming effect . obviously , these pszs would be located near an ear area of the headgear . miniature speakers driven by onboard integrated chips and battery power could provide this stimulus . music might be stored in the chip or preferably communicated to the chip wirelessly from a phone or tablet or computer by using , for example , bluetooth technology and paring the devices . a tactile sensation may be provided by means of finger - like protrusions that \u201c scratch \u201d the pet in key places like under the chin or the neck . another tactile stimuli might be bumps or ridges that apply pressure to key points on the animal . such pressure points may include the carotid body to perform a vagal maneuver to slow the heart rate and calm the animal . other useful pressure points are known to those versed in acupressure techniques . in some animals , it is calming to \u201c blind \u201d them visual stimuli . in such cases , an opaque cover over an eye opening may have a pleasant and calming effect as a psz . the foregoing description of the various aspects and embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description . it is not intended to be exhaustive of all embodiments or to limit the invention to the specific aspects disclosed . obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings and such modifications and variations may well fall within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly , legally and equitably entitled ."}

{"publication_number": "US-6136336-A", "abstract": "novel suppository pharmaceutical formulations of the platinum antitumor agent , jm216 , are provided . such dosage forms provide an alternative to the oral form currently available and offer improved bioavailability of this promising drug .", "application_number": "US-44462199-A", "description": "jm216 is a platinum antitumor complex having poor water - solubility . this low solubility may be associated with bioavailability problems seen in a recent phase i clinical study where the compound was orally administered in the form of hard gelatin capsules with excipients ( microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , lactose anhydrous and magnesium stearate ). it was an object of the present invention to find a way of increasing the aqueous solubility of jm216 so as to improve the bioavailability of the compound and perhaps also eliminate or reduce side effects seen with oral dosing such as nausea and vomitting . it was another object of the invention to develop a suppository dosage formulation of jm216 which could provide the same therapeutic advantages of the existing oral formulation while also improving the bioavailability . it was hoped that the suppository formulation would also have an improved side - effect profile as well as being an alternate dosage form for those patients who cannot tolerate oral dosing , e . g . infant patients or patients with disorders of the digestive organs . the present inventors first attempted to reduce the particle size of the jm216 powder obtained from chemical synthesis by grinding or milling it to an amorphous state ( as confirmed by x - ray diffraction pattern ). the amorphous state indicates the disappearance of particles or crystalline drug and a particle size close to the molecular level . however , it was found to be very difficult to obtain an amorphous state by simply grinding the drug alone owing to the re - aggregation of drug powder by electrostatic force during the grinding process . the addition of \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or polymers to the jm216 during the grinding did allow obtaining the drug as an amorphous powder by reduction of the aggregation . interestingly , the effect on solubility was quite dependent on the polymer used , with gelatin , polyvinylpyrrolidinone and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose showing marked improvement of dissolution rate over drug alone . the ratio of drug : \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer also has some effect on solubility , with solubility generally increasing at higher \u03b2 - cyclodextrin : drug or polymer : drug ratios . ratios of drug : \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer of from about 1 : 1 to about 1 : 15 ( w / w ) can be used with ratios of from about 1 : 4 to 1 : 15 being preferred and ratios of from about 1 : 9 to about 1 : 15 being most preferred . table i below shows dissolution results when various jm216 : polymer or jm216 : \u03b2 - cyclodextrin mixtures , after grinding with an automatic mortar for three hours , were evaluated in a standard dissolution test . table 1______________________________________dissolution of jm216 dissolved jm216 ( mg / ml ) 1 min . 5 min . 15 min . 30 min . 60 min . ______________________________________jm216 bulk drug alone 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 . 1jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 1 . 1 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 1 . 0jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 6jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 6jm216 : pvp ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : pullulan 0 . 5 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : peg 6000 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : avicel ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : lactose 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : \u03b2 -

cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixtures may be accomplished by standard procedures , e . g . automatic mortar and pestle machines or a hybridizer ( milling machine ). the time needed in the grinding process may be readily determined by simple test ( period analysis of the mixture by x - ray diffraction studies ). a suitable grinding time with the automatic mortar and pestle machine is three hours and with the hybridizer , five minutes . as can be seen from table i , use of amorphous jm216 with \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or certain polymer additives significantly increases the water - solubility of jm216 . the preferred formulations with increased solubility are those where the jm216 is ground to an amorphous state in the following drug : \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer ratios : such formulations result in approximately a doubling of the aqueous solubility over bulk jm216 powder alone and are one important aspect of the present invention . such amorphous jm216 can be used in a wide variety of jm216 pharmaceutical formulations , including both oral and non - oral forms , to improve the bioavailability of jm216 . the present inventors also explored developing a suppository dosage form of jm216 which would provide an alternative dosage form for those patients unable to use the current oral capsules . it was a goal to develop such a suppository dosage form which would have better absorption than the oral form and reduced side effects , e . g . nausea and vomitting . in their studies in vitro drug absorption of the test formulations was examined using excised rat rectum in accordance with the method described by t . ogiso et al in j . pharmacobio - dyn ., 14 , 385 ( 1991 ). the rectum was freshly excised from each rat and was opened lengthwise using scissors . the excised rectum , serous membrane side down , was mounted on a franz diffusion cell ( reservoir volume 10 ml , 7 mm i . d . o ring flange ). each preparation ( 80 mg ., 2 mg as jm216 ) was uniformly applied to the mucosal side and was occluded with a sheet of aluminum foil . gentamicin solution ( 10 mg / ml ) was added to the reservoir fluid ( phosphate buffer , ph 7 . 3 ) in the ratio of 1 : 100 . the assembly was incubated at 37 \u00b0 c . and aliquots ( 200 ( \u03bcl ) of the reservoir fluid were periodically withdrawn for 23 hours . the amount of jm216 permeated through rat rectum was determined by hplc . the various test samples were incorporated into standard suppository bases and then subjected to the in vitro drug absorption test . in addition , jm 216 powder alone and the ground anhydrous jm216 : \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixture suspended in water were also subjected to the tests . the suppository samples were prepared by fusion method melting the base at 50 \u00b0 c . for fatty bases or at 75 \u00b0 c . for polyethylene glycol water - soluble base . the drug was incorporated into the base at a concentration of 2 mg / 80 mg base . medium chain fatty acids ( or na salts thereof ) and surface active agents were also added at the appropriate level . the results in the rat rectum absorption model are as shown below in table ii . table ii__________________________________________________________________________jm216 absorption through excised rat rectum suppository jm216 absorbed (%) drug additives bases 14 h 17 h 20 h 23 h__________________________________________________________________________jm216 water 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 ( non -

amorphous ) was little absorbed in the form of a suspension in water or in fatty suppository bases . the drug alone was , however , absorbed to some extent when incorporated into the water - soluble base , polyethylene glycol ( peg ). peg was thus determined to be the most appropriate suppository base for jm216 . peg having molecular weights of from about 400 - 6000 is preferred ( the peg used in the above study was a mixture of 400 , 1500 and 4000 ( 2 : 1 : 5 , w / w ) molecular weight material ). based on their experience , the present inventors determined that in the rat rectum absorption model a percentage absorption of 4 % or greater was considered necessary for a commercially useful suppository formulation of jm216 . addition of certain fatty acids to the peg suppository base containing non - amorphous jm216 gave the desired absorption levels while similar peg formulations without these fatty acids were unacceptable . the amorphous jm216 produced by grinding or milling jm216 with \u03b2 - cyclodextrin or polymers , particularly gelatin , hpmc or pvp , can also be added to a peg suppository base and certain fatty acids , particulary caproic acid or its sodium salt , caprylic acid or its sodium salt , capric acid or its sodium salt and the sodium salt of oleic acid , to obtain a suppository dosage form having excellent absorption properties . the fatty acid is used in an amount of from 0 . 5 to 10 % ( w / w ) of the total suppository weight . addition of surface active agents to the suppositories employing a peg base , amorphous jm216 and a fatty acid selected from caproic acid or its sodium salt , caprylic acid or its sodium salt , capric acid or its sodium salt and the sodium salt of oleic acid also resulted in suppository formulations showing high absorption . again , in the case of amorphous jm216 , material made by grinding jm216 with gelatin , hpmc , pvp or \u03b2 - cyclodextrin , is preferred for achieving the best absorption results . the surface active agent is employed in an amount of from 0 . 5 to 7 % of the total suppository weight . preferred surface active agents include tween 80 and pluronic ( e . g . pluronic f68 ). the jm216 , whether amorphous or non - amorphous , is used in an amount of from 0 . 1 to 10 % ( w / w ) of the total suppository weight . particularly preferred suppository formulations according to the present invention include the following : jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ), peg suppository base , 3 % capryl na , 3 % pluronic surface active agent jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ), peg suppository base , 3 % capryl na , 3 % tween 80 surface active agent the suppository formulations are prepared by mixing of the jm216 and fatty acid with a peg suppository base by any recognized method of making suppositories using water - soluble peg bases . the surface active agents and other excipients such as miglyol can also be added to the mixture . the dosage amount of jm216 in the suppository formulation is sufficient to insure the release of sufficient dosage units of jm216 into the blood to provide the desired therapeutic effect and may be readily determined by those skilled in the art by simple test . peg400 , peg1500 and peg6000 were mixed in a ratio of 2 : 1 : 5 ( w / w ) and then melted at 75 \u00b0 c . the ground mixture ( 20 g ) of jm216 and gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) was added to the melted peg mixture ( 57 . 6 g ) and stirred until the ground mixture was dispersed homogeneously . sodium caproate ( 2 . 4 g ) was added and then stirred for a short time at 70 \u00b0 c . the mass was immediately poured into molds and allowed to solidify at room temperature . the above process was carried out in a light -

s leg , nerves and blood vessels while the worker is kneeling , yet maintain security of the knee pad when the worker is standing or walking . the cap 204 , straps 214 , suspension components 212 , guide rails 216 and guide plate 218 cooperate to achieve this feature , as well as providing a uniform alignment of the cap 204 with the base 202 , and providing extended comfort to the user . referring to fig5 and 6 , another embodiment of a knee pad assembly 300 is shown . the base 302 comprises a knee cup 304 and a suspension member 306 disposed on the outer front surface of the base . an outer cover or shell 308 is disposed over knee cup 304 and suspension member 306 by straps 310 . this arrangement allows force applied to the cover to compress the collapsible or suspension member towards the base to provide cushioning . the edges of the cover 308 slide toward the user &# 39 ; s knee along the outer perimeter surface of the base . when the pressure on the cover is released , the suspension member 306 expands to its original shape . in one variant , the suspension member 306 is partially collapsible in order to provide adequate support and air space while collapsible enough to provide desired cushioning . in addition open areas 312 in suspension member 306 allow additional cushioning and support for the knee . similar to the embodiments described and depicted in fig3 and 4 , the contact and cooperation between cover or shell 308 and suspension member 306 provides a floating type suspension for the knee while the knee pad 300 is strapped to a user by straps 310 . referring to fig7 , depicted is yet another exemplary embodiment where knee pad assembly 400 is comprised of base 402 , which is a partial shell that is disposed behind the user &# 39 ; s leg , such as on the calf and behind the knee , and cap 404 . for example , straps or a neoprene back of leg wrap 402 may be substituted for the base and straps described in the preceding examples . the cover 404 is then placed over the knee cap and restrained in place via tension members 418 , such as cords , on either side of the base spanning between the base and the cover . this arrangement promotes good pressure management on the user &# 39 ; s knee and leg . the cover 404 is shown with a honeycomb pattern 420 in a soft rubber material in order to enhance traction and provide cushioning for the user . a further feature illustrated in this example is the ratchet system 422 disposed on top of cover structure 404 and functionally connected to the tension members 418 . via the ratchet system 422 , the wearer has the ability to tighten or loosen strap pressure ( snugness ) of the knee pad . a dial 424 or other user actuator is provided to allow the user to actuate the ratchet system . referring to fig8 through 15 , depicted are various means to removeably attach a pad to a base . fig8 provides a base 502 with one or more sleeves or pockets 504 to receive the tongues 508 of cover 506 . the front receiving surface 510 of the base 502 and back surface 511 of cover 506 , may further be provided with a respective portion of a hook and loop fastener 512 to further secure the cover to the base . the cover 506 shown in this example is a generally rectangular and slightly curved semi - rigid board comprising a polyethylene material . however , the board can vary in size , shape and material as appropriate for the particular usage . referring to fig9 , an exemplar knee pad assembly is shown with another cover fastening means . an elastic hem 522 is provided around the perimeter 524 of the cover receiving surface 526 of the base 520 . the perimeter 528 of the cover 530 includes corresponding protruding tabs or projections 532 that are sized and shaped for being received in the elastic hem 522 . hook and loop 527 may also be used as shown in fig8 , and can further be used with all embodiment disclosed herein . referring to fig1 , a further embodiment of a knee pad assembly is shown . the base and cover is shown in fig9 . in addition , an overlay cover 534 is now provided . the overlay cover 534 is disposed over the cover 530 and then secured to the base with a plurality of reinforced strap loops 536 . the straps 538 used to secure the base to the knee region of the user are placed through the reinforced loops 536 of the overlay cover 534 to secure the cover and overlay in place . referring to fig1 , another embodiment of a knee pad assembly is shown . the cover or overlay 540 includes a plurality of elastic bands or cords 542 . the cords 542 can extend through the cover 540 for better securement . a tab 544 is provided at an approximate mid - point of each band 542 . the cover 540 is secured to the base 546 by inserting the tabs 544 into respective slots or pockets 548 in the base 546 . channels 550 in the outer perimeter surface 552 of the base 546 may be provided to further retain the bands in place . hook and loop fasteners 554 may further be provided on respective portions of the cover and base to further secure the cover to the base . fig1 illustrates a cord - lock means 562 for securing the cover 564 to the base 566 . raised corners 568 on the cover are inserted behind portions of the locking cord 570 . the locking cord or cords 570 are then tightened by pulling on cords 563 and retainer 562 is then used to maintain the tension in the retaining cord ( s ). fig1 through 15 illustrate other exemplar attachment embodiment means for a knee pad assembly . the cover or overlay 578 includes a plurality of elastic bands or cords 572 shown at the corners of the cover 578 . the cords can extend through the cover in a crossing pattern or \u201c x \u201d shape 574 for better securement , as shown in fig1 . a tab 576 is provided at an approximate mid - point of each band 572 . the cover 578 is secured to the base 580 by inserting the tabs 576 into respective slots or pockets 582 in the base at the corners thereof . the corner pockets may be raised to facilitate insertion and removal of the tabs . fig1 further illustrates that cover 578 may be used to secure pads used in previous embodiments to a base such as base 580 . note that the underlayment of pad 584 of fig1 includes a plurality of slots 586 for receiving the knee pad retaining straps 581 . the compressibility factor ( including material property and physical dimensions and shape ) of the collapsible or suspension members disclosed herein can be varied to accommodate different user weight ranges and to accommodate a user &# 39 ;

450 cm in length and 0 . 008 - 0 . 038 inches in diameter depending on the medical application . the distal portion 25 of core 20 may be tapered to provide flexibility to guide wire 10 . preferably the tapered distal portion 25 is formed by grinding 5 - 20 cm of core 20 . the tapered distal portion 25 may be ground into a conical shape with a circular cross - section or stamped such that it has a rectangular cross - section . core 20 may be formed of a super - elastic material such as the alloys of nickel and titanium , commonly known as nitinol . while nitinol is the most common super - elastic material , any of a variety of other super - elastic materials may be used for core 20 . other alloys by chemical name include ; cualni , cusn , cuzn , inti , nial , fept , mncu , and femnsi . a detailed discussion of super - elastic alloys and their processing is presented in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 925 , 445 to sakamoto and is herein incorporated by reference . in addition to super - elastic materials , linear - elastic materials may be used . linear - elastic materials are describe in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 238 , 004 to sahatjian which is also incorporated by reference . in general , linear - elastic materials are composed of the same alloys above . however , different material processing strategies are used to provide a wire which has many of the important characteristics of a super - elastic material without some of the difficulties related to machining , specifically grinding . as such , core 20 may preferably be formed of a linear - elastic alloy of nickel - titanium . surrounding core 20 is coil 30 . coil over core wires are well known in the art and are described in detail in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 147 , 317 to shank which is incorporated by reference . coil 30 may be made of a variety of metallic materials including super - elastic or linear - elastic materials such as nitinol , radio - opaque materials such as gold or tungsten , precipitation hardenable alloys such as the non - ferrous cobalt - based alloys mp35n or elgiloy \u2122 and the ferrous alloys such as k91 from sanvic corp . and ph455 from carpenter , or more conventional stainless steel alloys such as 304 . preferably coil 30 may be 0 . 001 - 0 . 015 inches in diameter , and made of 304 stainless steel . coil 30 is wrapped around substantially the entire length of core 20 . preferably , coil 30 is not wrapped around the tapered distal portion 25 of core 20 . coil 30 may be formed of flat ribbon ranging in dimensions 0 . 001 - 0 . 003 inches in thickness by 0 . 005 to 0 . 015 inches in width . coil 30 is wrapped in a helical fashion about core 20 by conventional winding techniques . the pitch of adjacent turns of coil 30 may be tightly wrapped so that each turn touches the succeeding turn or the pitch may be set such that coil 30 is wrapped about core 20 in an open fashion shown at 35 . preferably , the pitch coil 30 is such that the coils are tightly wrapped over most of the proximal portion of core 20 with the pitch of each turn changing such that coil 30 has an open wrap shown at 35 near the distal end of core 20 . varying the pitch of coil 30 allows guide wire 10 to have a more flexible distal segment . alternatively , coil 30 may be formed of cross - wound multifilar or multifilar single coil wire . multifilar cross - wound coils are described in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 932 , 419 to de toledo which is herein incorporated by reference . a cross - wound multifilar coil consists essentially of a first inner coil of multiple coil wires wound in a first helical direction and a second outer coil of multiple coil wires disposed about the first coil and wound in a second opposite helical direction . coil over core wires tend to wind up and store energy when torqued rather than transmitting the torque . multifilar coils provides less wind up and therefore lessen the potential for the distal tip of the wire to whip while the proximal end is being turned . bonding core 20 to coil 30 also improves the torque transmission of guide wire 10 . coil 30 may be bonded to core 20 along the length of core 20 or in discrete sections . bonding may be achieved in a variety of ways including using adhesives , brazing , welding , crimping , and swaging . welding may be done through any of the techniques known in the art including spot welding using laser or resistance welding or ball welding using laser or plasma welding . soldering may be done through any of the techniques known in the art and must include the step of preparing the surface of the nitinol core 20 by plating or etching . preferably the coil 30 will be bonded to the core 20 by laser spot welding thereby removing the need for preparing the surface of the core 20 . laser spot welding is also advantageous because it may be done through coatings . an alternative method of bonding the coil 30 to the core 20 is to provide a stainless steel hypotube ( not shown ) with an inner diameter dimensioned to closely fit about core 20 . the stainless steel hypotube may then be crimped onto core 20 and the coil 30 wound about the hypotube . the hypotube then provides a surface which is much easier to bound to a stainless steel coil 30 using conventional methods . metal a foils or other materials may also be used as an intermediate which facilitates bonding between the coil 30 and the core 20 . yet another bonding method utilizes the polymer jacket 40 of the distal tip . the polymer may be applied in a manner that allows the polymer to flow between the coil and core . the polymer will provide a high integrity bond which will help to prevent the polymer jacket from separating from the coil 30 and bond the coil to core 20 . in addition to the these improvements , the polymer coating will make a better transition from the core 20 to the distal portion 25 . a tip bonded in this manor provides a further improvement by producing coloration differences between the coil wire and polymer . these differences act as stripes for the detection of guidewire advance in endoscopy application . the distal portion 25 of core wire 20 may further include a polymer tip 40 . polymer tip 40 serves several functions . polymer tip 40 improves the flexibility of the distal portion 25 of core wire 20 . choice of polymers for polymer tip 40 will vary the flexibility of the distal portion 25 of core wire 20 . for example , polymers with a low durometer or hardness will make a very flexible or floppy tip . conversely , polymers with a high durometer will make a wire tip which is stiffer . polymer tip 40 also provides a more atraumatic tip for guide wire 10 . an atraumatic tip is better suited for passing through fragile body passages . finally , polymer tip 40 may act as a binder for radio - opaque materials . loading polymers with radio - opaque materials is well known in the art for producing a bright image under fluoroscopy and thereby allowing the user of guide wire 10 a better understanding of where the distal portion 25 of guide wire 10 is located within a patient &# 39 ; s body . suitable medical grade radio - opaque materials include tungsten , platinum , and iridium . suitable polymeric materials for polymer tip 40 include urethanes , elastomeric nylons such as pebax , silicones , and co - polymers . polymer tip 40 may be a single polymer , multiple layers , or a blend of polymers . coating ( not shown ) may also be done to the wire proximal to polymer tip 40 . hydrophobic coatings such as fluoropolymers provide a dry lubricity which improves guide wire handling and device exchanges . a second lubricious polymer ( not shown ) may coat distal portion 25 of guide wire 10 or the entire wire 10 . lubricious coatings improve steerability and improve lesion crossing capability . suitable lubricious polymers are well known in the art and may include hydrophilic polymers . guide wire 10 may further include a colored coating . colored guide wires are described in detail in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 739 , 779 to rowland which is herein incorporated by reference . in general , colored coatings may improve the visibility of the guide wire when it is being used in an endoscopic procedure . striping may also be done . striping allows the physician to gauge wire movement and position . striping may be achieved by spray coating different colors on the wire 10 . another way to stripe the wire 10 is to coat the wires of coil 30 prior to winding . fig2 depicts a second embodiment of the high performance coil wire where like elements are similarly numbered . all design advantages , materials of construction , and methods of manufacture are similar to those described above unless explicitly modified below . guide wire 10 is comprised of a solid core 20 surrounded by a coil 30 . the distal portion 25 of core 20 may be tapered as described above or preferably is not tapered . similar to the embodiment of fig1 , the distal portion 35 of coil 30 changes pitch to provide a softer less traumatic tip . guide wire 10 further includes a rounded tip 37 . tip 37 may be polymeric or a metal tip welded to the distal portion 35 of coil 30 . unlike common spring tipped guide wires , guide wire 10 does not have a safety ribbon connecting core 20 to tip 37 . instead guide wire 10 may include a polymer 40 which may be flowed into the space between coils 35 and the space between the distal portion 25 and tip 37 . as shown in fig2 , polymer 40 flows proximally from tip 37 and terminates at a distal facing surface of a proximal portion of coil 30 without any portion of the polymer 40 extending proximally of the distal facing surface of the proximal portion of coil 30 . suitable polymers are described above where choice of polymer may control the flexibility of the tip . polymer 40 may also be loaded with radio - opaque materials . finally , guide wire 10 may be coated as described above and may also include various colors or stripes . the distal portion of guide wire 10 is thereby provided with a very floppy tip which uses polymer 40 as a safety ribbon instead of a metallic safety ribbon . guide wire 10 is provided with the advantage that core 20 does not need to be ground . while the specification describes the preferred designs , materials , methods of manufacture and methods of use , those skilled in the art will appreciate the scope and spirit of the invention with reference to the following claims ."}

mole of maltose per minute at a concentration of 10 mg of maltotriose substrate per ml in 0 . 1 m citrate buffer at ph 5 . 0 , 37 \u00b0 c . for 30 minutes . the amino acid sequence of a maltogenic alpha -

amylase . using the novamyl structure 1qho and the sucrose docking in fig1 , the following novamyl residues are within 4 \u00e5 : k44 , n86 , y89 , h90 , y92 , w93 , f188 , t189 , d190 , p191 , a192 , f194 , d372 , p373 , r376 . further the following positions have been identified as relevant : i15 , r81 , t87 , g88 , l196 , n371 or n375 of seq id no : 1 . the alteration may be a substitution or deletion of one or more of the selected residues , or one or more residues ( particularly 1 - 4 residues or 5 - 6 residues ) can be inserted adjacent to a selected residue . the substitution may be with a smaller or larger residue . a substitution to increase the size of the residue may diminish the space obtained by the docked sucrose molecule thereby preventing the binding of sucrose . amino acid residues are ranked as follows from smallest to largest : ( an equal sign indicates residues with sizes that are practically indistinguishable ): the substitution may also be such as to eliminate contacts with the sucrose molecule , in particular by moving or removing potential sites of hydrogen bonding or van der waals interactions . the substitution may particularly be with another residue of the same type where the type is negative , positive , hydrophobic or hydrophilic . the negative residues are d , e , the positive residues are k / r , the hydrophobic residues are a , c , f , g , i , l , m , p , v , w , y , and the hydrophilic residues are h , n , q , s , t . some particular examples of substitutions are i15t / s / v / l , r18k , k44r / s / t / q / n , n86q / s / t , t87n / q / s , g88a / s / t , y89w / f / h , h90w / fn / r / k / n / q / m , w93y / f / m / e / g / v / t / s , f188h / l / i / t / g / v , d190e / q / g , a192s / t , f194s / ln , l196f , n371k / r / fn / q , d372e / q / s / t / a and n375s / t / d / e / q . examples of deletions are deletion of residue 191 or 192 . an example of an insertion is ala inserted between 192 and 193 . the polypeptide may include other alterations compared to novamyl ( seq id no : 1 ), e . g . alterations to increase the thermostability as described in u . s . pat . no . 6 , 162 , 628 . in this specification , an amino acid substitution is described by use of one -

sucrose dough may be selected so as to have mainly exo - amylase activity . more specifically , the amylase hydrolyzes amylose so that the average molecular weight of the amylose after 0 . 4 - 4 % hydrolysis is more than 50 % ( particularly more than 75 %) of the molecular weight before the hydrolysis . thus , the amylase may hydrolyze amylose ( e . g . wheat amylose or synthetic amylose ) so that the average molecular weight of the amylose after 0 . 4 - 4 % hydrolysis ( i . e . between 0 . 4 - 4 % hydrolysis of the total number of bonds ) is more than 50 % ( particularly more than 75 %) of the value before the hydrolysis . the hydrolysis can be conducted in a 1 . 7 % amylose solution by weight at suitable conditions ( e . g . 10 minutes at 60 \u00b0 c ., ph 5 . 5 ), and the molecular weight distribution before and after the hydrolysis can be determined by hplc . the test may be carried out as described in c . christophersen et al ., starch 50 ( 1 ), 39 - 45 ( 1998 ). an exo - amylase for use in high - sucrose dough may have a specified sugar tolerance . compared to its activity in the absence of sucrose , the amylase may have more than 20 % activity at 10 % sugar , more than 10 % activity at 20 % sucrose , or more than 4 % activity at 40 % sucrose . the sugar tolerance may be determined as described in the examples . the exo -

amylase may be non - liquefying . this can be determined by letting the exo - amylase act on a 1 % wheat starch solution until the reaction is complete , i . e . addition of fresh enzyme causes no further degradation , and analyzing the reaction products , e . g . by hplc . typical reaction conditions are e . g . 0 . 01 mg enzyme per ml starch solution for 48 hours . the exo - amylase is considered non - liquefying if the amount of residual starch after the reaction is at least 20 % of the initial amount of starch . the exo - amylase may have maltogenic alpha - amylase activity ( ec 3 . 2 . 1 . 133 ). the exo - amylase may be the amylase described in dk pa 2004 00021 , or it may be a novamyl variant described in this specification . the dough may have a sucrose content above 10 % by weight , particularly above 20 % or 30 %, e . g . 30 - 40 %. the flour content is typically 25 - 35 % by weight of total ingredients . the dough may be made by a conventional cake recipe , typically with cake flour , sugar , fat / oil and eggs as the major ingredients . it may include other conventional ingredients such as emulsifiers , humectants , gums , starch and baking powder . it generally contains such ingredients as soft wheat flour , milk or other liquids , sugar , eggs , chemical leaveners , flavor extracts and spices , as well as others that may or may not include shortening . the dough is generally heat treated , e . g . by baking or deep frying to prepare an edible product such as cakes including pound cake , yellow and white layer cakes , cakes containing chocolate and cocoa products , sponge cakes , angel food cake , fruit cakes and foam - type cakes and doughnuts . the amylase activity of a number of polypeptides were tested by incubation with phadebas tablets ( product of pharmacia \u00ae) for 15 minutes at 60 \u00b0 c . in the presence of sucrose at various concentrations ( in % by weight ). the results are expressed in % of the result without sugar : a number of polypeptides were tested as in example 1 . the results are expressed as activity with 10 % sucrose in % of the activity without sucrose : the following variants are also considered of interest in the context of the present invention : the following amylases were tested for thermostability and sugar tolerance : bacterial alpha - amylase from b . amyloliquefaciens ( ban \u2122, product of novozymes a / s ), fungal alpha - amylase from a . oryzae ( fungamyl \u00ae, product of novozymes a / s ), maltogenic alpha - amylase having the sequence of seq id no : 1 ( novamyl \u00ae, product of novozymes a / s ), a novamyl variant having seq id no : 1 with the substitutions f188l + d261g + t288p , and bacterial alpha - amylase from b . licheniformis ( termamyl \u00ae, product of novozymes a / s ). the five amylases were tested for exo - amylase activity as described above . the results show that novamyl and the novamyl variant had exo - amylase activity by this test , and the other three did not . each amylase was incubated at 85 \u00b0 c . at ph 5 . 7 ( 50 mm na - acetate , 1 mm cacl 2 ) without substrate , and the amylase activity was measured after 0 , 15 , 30 and 60 minutes heat treatment . the results are expressed as residual activity in % of the initial activity : the results show that the novamyl variant and termamyl were not deactivated by the heat - treatment . ban and fungamyl lose all their activity after 15 min while novamyl loses it gradually with heat - treatment time . the experiment was repeated in 10 % sucrose solution . the results are expressed as residual activity in % of the initial activity without sucrose : the results show that ban and termamyl were not inhibited by sugar while fungamyl and the novamyl variant were somewhat inhibited , and novamyl was heavily inhibited by sugar . the combination of sugar and heat - treatment shows that the novamyl variant and termamyl could be active during baking of cakes . termamyl and the novamyl variant fulfill the criterion for thermostability and sugar tolerance used in this invention . sponge cakes were made with addition of amylase as follows : ban ( 0 . 83 . 8 . 3 or 83 mg / kg flour ), novamyl ( 1 . 3 or 13 mg / kg flour ) or the novamyl variant used in example 1 ( 1 , 10 10 or 100 mg / kg flour ). a control cake was made without amylase . the cakes were baked according to the high ratio sponge sandwich cake ( hrssc ) method . after baking , the cakes were cooled down for 60 - 120 minutes , and the cakes were stored at room temperature in sealed plastic bags filled with nitrogen until analysis . the cakes were evaluated on day 1 , 3 , 7 or 23 . texture profile analysis ( tpa ) was performed as described in bourne m . c . ( 2002 ) 2 . ed ., food texture and viscosity : concept and measurement . academic press . the results showed that the increase in hardness was slower with increasing dosage of the novamyl variant . the addition of ban or novamyl had only a slight effect , and only at the highest dosage . the cohesiveness of the cakes decreased with storage time . the addition of the novamyl variant delayed this decrease . the addition of ban or novamyl had a slight effect , and only at the highest dosage . water mobility was characterized by low field nmr . the addition of the novamyl variant and ban increased the mobility , indicating that the two amylases were able to keep the cakes more moist . novamyl had virtually no effect . a small sensory evaluation of softness and moistness was performed on day 13 for the 3 cakes with the novamyl variant and the control cake . the cakes were evaluated regarding three parameters ; firmness , moistness and preferability . the control was the firmest , driest and least preferred . the higher dosage of the novamyl variant , the less firm ( softer ), moister and better liked . a large panel sensory evaluation was performed on day 13 . it was a paired comparison test where a control cake was compare to the cake with the novamyl variant at the highest dosage . a 30 - member panel was asked two questions ( 1 ) which cake is moister and ( 2 ) which cake is fresher . all panel members agreed on that the cake with the novamyl variant was moister and fresher . the preference was significant at a significance level above 99 . 999 %. to summarize , the data show that the novamyl variant had anti - staling properties and was able to improve moistness perception and moistness measured by nmr . the two other amylases had only a slight effect . cakes were made with addition of amylase as follows : ban ( 0 . 83 . 8 . 3 or 83 mg / kg flour ) or the novamyl variant used in example 1 ( 1 , 10 or 100 mg / kg flour ). a control cake was made without amylase . cakes were baked according to the high ratio unit cake ( hruc ) method . after baking , the cakes were cooled down for 60 - 120 minutes , and the cakes were stored at room temperature in sealed plastic bags filled with nitrogen until analysis . the cakes were evaluated on day 7 , 20 and 34 by the same methods as in the previous example . the increase in hardness was slower with the novamyl variant at the highest dosage . the addition of ban to the cake resulted in a low volume and a doughy cake which gave poor results in hardness measurements . the addition of the novamyl variant delayed the decrease in cohesiveness while ban did not influence it at all . the novamyl variant and ban were able to keep the cake more moist than the control . this increase in mobility of the free water could partly be explained by the cakes with ban and the novamyl variant being able to retain the moisture content . a small sensory evaluation on day 34 showed that the cake with the novamyl variant at the highest dosage was clearly better than the control cake ; it was more moist and it was less crumbly . over - all , there was an anti - staling effect of the novamyl variant at the high dosage , similar to the effect on sponge cakes in the previous example . the staling of hruc cakes was slower than sponge cakes but it was still evident that the novamyl variant had an anti - staling effect . the anti - staling effect was seen with texture analysis , nmr and sensory evaluation . ban showed anti - staling effects in hruc but it was sensitive to over - dosage which resulted in cake collapse and a doughy cake . sponge cakes were made with addition of the amylase of dk pa 2004 00021 at dosages 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 5 and 20 mg / kg flour and a control cake without amylase . texture and nmr was measured on day 1 , 7 and 13 . the addition of the amylase reduced the increase in firmness , especially at the highest dosage . the amylase also had a beneficial effect on the mobility of water which was correlated with the moistness of the cake . a blind sensory ranking evaluation performed on day 14 showed a ranking according to the dosage , the higher dosage the more soft and moist cake . the most preferred cake was the one with the highest dosage . the ingredients were scaled into a mixing bowl and mixed using an industrial mixer ( e . g . bj\u00f8rn a r 5 a varimixer ) with a suitable paddle speed . 300 g of the dough was poured into forms . the cakes are baked in a suitable oven ( e . g . sveba dahlin deck oven ) for 45 min . at 180 \u00b0 c . the cakes were allowed to cool down at room temperature for 1 hour . the volume of the cakes was determined when the cakes had cooled down using the rape seed displacement method . the cakes were packed under nitrogen in sealed plastic bags and stored at room temperature until analysis . the cakes were evaluated on day 1 , 7 and 14 , two cakes were used at each occasions . the cohesiveness and hardness of the cakes was evaluated with texture analyser and the water mobility was characterized by low field nmr . the texture profile analysis ( tpa ) was performed as described in bourne m . c . ( 2002 ) 2 . ed ., food texture and viscosity : concept and measurement . academic press . the mobility of free water was determined as described by p . l . chen , z . long , r . ruan and t . p . labuza , nuclear magnetic resonance studies of water mobility in bread during storage . lebensmittel wissenschaft and technologie 30 , 178 - 183 ( 1997 ). the mobility of free water has been described in literature to correlate to moistness of bread crumb . compared to cakes with no addition of enzymes the volume of the cakes is not affected by the addition of the reference enzyme ( seq id no . : 1 ) nor by the addition of variants hereof , i . e . the cakes did not collapse upon addition of enzyme . the cohesiveness of the cakes decreased with storage time . the addition of variants of seq id no : 1 delayed this decrease as can be seen in table 1 . the free water mobility is correlated with the moist perception of the cake crumb , it decreases with time . the addition of the novamyl variants increased the mobility compared to the control , indicating that the amylases were able to keep the cakes more moist . results are listed in table 2 . the hardness of the cakes increased with storage time . the addition of variants of seq id no : 1 delayed this increase in hardness as can be seen in table 3 ."}

( hereinafter , unless otherwise noted , \u201c pore size \u201d for such filters shall refer to the minimum pore size of the smaller pores .) at present , of the anopore \u2122 anodized aluminum porous filters commercially available from anotec separations , those of pore size under 200 nm are of the branched - pore structure , and those of pore size of 200 nm or larger are of uniform pore size from one surface to the other . when the desired average particle size of the liposomes is less than about 200 nm , then the preferred pore size of the filter is less than about 100 nm . these filters are also of the preferred branched - pore type structure . these aluminum oxide filters are hydrophilic ; they do not swell in aqueous solvents ; they have good organic solvent resistance ; and they have pores of uniform size which promote high flow - through characteristics . because of the properties of such films , it was found that liposomes could be extruded through them at relatively high flow rates under relatively low pressure ( see example 3 , below ). thus , aluminum oxide filters are shown to be superior for extruding liposomes over the previously known polymeric filters . in the present invention , the branched - pore filters are preferably used so that the liposomes enter the face with the smaller size pores and exit though the face with the larger size pores . however , as shown in the examples below , good extrusion can also be obtained with a filter mounted in the inverted position , so that the liposomes enter the large pore - size face . in accordance with the process of present invention , a population of liposomes substantially free of liposomes above a predetermined maximum size is produced from a suspension of liposomes , a portion of which are of sizes larger than the predetermined maximum size . the process includes passing the suspension of liposomes under pressure one or more times through an aluminum oxide porous film , such as one of the type described above . to determine whether a population of liposomes is \u201c substantially free of liposomes above a predetermined maximum size \u201d, the liposomes can be tested using a standard sizer . one such standard sizer is a malvern sizer , available from malvern instruments , malvern , england , which is described and used in some of the examples below . another sizer which can used to determine particle size distributions is a nicomp \u2122 laser particle sizer , available from hiac / royco instruments , menlo park , calif ., which is also described and used in some of the examples below . in the particle size distributions reported in the examples below , a test result indicating that 0 . 0 percent of the liposomes present in the population are above a given size indicates that the population is \u201c substantially free \u201d of such large - size liposomes . although not required , the particle size , and particularly the particle - size distribution , of liposomes may be made smaller and more uniform by extruding though a larger filter as a first step . for example , extruding the liposomes through a suitable filter of 2 - 10 micrometer size , such as one made from polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ), as is well known in the art , will reduce the particle size and particle - size distribution prior to extruding through the aluminum oxide filter , and may thereby reduce the time for extrusion . the pressure during the extrusion will be varied depending upon the liposomes employed , their mean particle diameter and particle - size distribution , and the rate of flow desired . extrusion pressures may vary from about 200 to about 1000 psi ( 1 . 4 - 6 . 9 mpa ), but pressures of less than about 600 psi ( 4 . 2 mpa ) are preferred . in general , fewer extrusion passes are required when using the branched - pore type aluminum oxide filters of the present invention , as opposed to the previously known polycarbonate filters , for similar results in terms of particle size , particle - size distribution and flow rates . however , repeated extrusion passes through the aluminum oxide filters may be used to obtain a narrower particle - size distribution , and particularly to reduce all liposomes to below a predetermined maximum size . for example , 2 - 10 extrusions of the liposomes through the filters are preferred to decrease the particle - size distribution , thereby producing relatively uniform liposomes of high capacity in a rapid , efficient and inexpensive manner . multiple extrusions may also convert multilamellar vesicles to more desired oligolamellar or unilamellar forms . subsequent to the extrusion process of the invention , any free unencapsulated therapeutic agent or other solution can be readily removed , as by dialysis or diafiltration , leaving stable drug encapsulating liposomes of relatively uniform size . the resultant liposomes may be readily measured into uniform dosages for administration parenterally or orally . the invention will be further illustrated by the following examples , but the invention is not meant to be limited to the details described therein . three batches of liposomes ( hereinafter designated a , b and c ) were prepared as follows : 71 . 3 mg / ml egg phosphatidylcholine ( obtained from princeton lipids , princeton , n . j .) and 28 . 7 mg / ml cholesterol ( j . t . baker , phillipsburg , n . j .) were dissolved in 0 . 15 to 0 . 5 ml of methylene chloride and added to a 300 - mm citrate buffer solution ( ph 4 . 0 ) to make up a 1 - ml volume . the methylene chloride was removed by heating the mixture to about 40 \u00b0 c . to aid in the removal of the solvent , nitrogen was sparged through batches a and c , while batch b was heated under partial vacuum . the resultant liposomes were vesicles of various sizes and various size distributions . the initial size distributions of these liposomes prior to size reduction were measured on a malvern sizer 3600 e type with a 63 - mm lens , available from malvern instruments , malvern , england . the results are presented in table i , in which the mean diameters and size distribution ranges are expressed in micrometers ( um ). before extrusion , batch b was presized through a 5 - um pore - size mitex \u2122 ptfe filter ( millipore corp ., bedford , mass . ), and the mean diameter and distribution range for the batch b liposomes after presizing is included in the table . batches a and c were not put through presizing . the results show a considerable batch - to - batch variation in the size distribution of the unsized liposomes . in accordance with the present invention , the liposomes of example 1 were extruded five times under pressure through an anopore \u2122 90 - mm diameter , 100 - nm pore size ( small pores ) branched - pore aluminum oxide filter of the type described above . the placement of the filter for batches a and b was with the input through the small - pore surface . good results were also obtained for batch c , which was extruded with the filter inverted so that the input was through the large - pore surface . the mean diameter of the liposomes and the particle - size distributions of the liposomes were measured after the indicated passes through the filter . the size distributions were measured on a nicomp \u2122 model 370 laser particle sizer , available from hiac / royco instruments , menlo park , calif . the results measured after each extrusion pass are summarized in table ii : for comparison , a sample of the liposomes prepared in batch c of example i was extruded through a total of eight passes , first five times through a 90 - mm diameter , 200 - nm pore size nuclepore \u2122 polycarbonate filters , two times through a 100 - nm nuclepore \u2122 filter , and once though a 220 - nm sterilization filter . ( nuclepore \u2122 filters are commercially available from nuclepore , inc ., pleasanton , calif .) a second sample was extruded in four passes through a 90 - mm diameter , 100 - nm pore size anopore \u2122 filter , in accordance with the present invention . as with the first sample , this sample was then passed through a 220 - nm sterilization filter . size data was measured after the pass numbers indicated in the first column . all of the extrusions were conducted at the same pressure of 400 psi ( 2 . 8 mpa ). the results are presented in table iii : the branched - pore type aluminum oxide filters of the present invention required fewer passes with a higher flow rate than the polycarbonate filters to obtain a similar particle - size distribution . an additional test was conducted to compare the size - reduction capabilities of a branched - pore type anodized aluminum oxide film with an equivalent pore - sized polycarbonate filter . the tests were performed using egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol liposomes , made in accordance with example 1 , with the liposomes in aqueous suspension at 100 mg / ml . for this example , the cholesterol was obtained from croda chemicals , new york , n . y . the initial size distribution , as measured on the malvern sizer , showed a median diameter of 10 . 9 um , and a range of diameters of 2 . 4 to 118 um . to facilitate submicron size reduction , the batch was processed twice through a 5 - um mitex \u2122 ptfe filter at a pressure of 100 psi ( 0 . 7 mpa ). after this step , the median diameter of the liposomes was measured as 3 . 5 um , and the range of diameters was 1 . 9 to 11 um . the batch was divided into two portions . portion number one was extruded through a 0 . 1 micrometer anopore \u2122 filter , and portion two was extruded through a 0 . 1 micrometer nuclepore \u2122 polycarbonate filter . the starting extrusion pressure for both portions was 300 psi ( 2 . 1 mpa ). the extrusion flow rate , particle size , and particle size distribution were measured for each pass through the filters . a total of five passes were performed on each portion . the results are presented in table iv : these data demonstrate that both filters are capable of producing similar size distributions with the same number of passes . however , the aluminum oxide filter used for the first portion required less pressure and operated at a much higher flow rate than the polycarbonate filter used for the second portion . all of the passes through the aluminum oxide filter were conducted at 300 psi ( 2 . 1 mpa ), with flow rates of 0 . 6 - 0 . 8 liters / min . when the extrusion was repeated using the polycarbonate filter , the initial pressure had to be increased from 300 psi ( 2 . 1 mpa ) to 500 psi ( 3 . 4 mpa ) just to complete the first pass through the filter at a very low flow rate of 0 . 02 liter / min . for passes 2 through 5 , a higher pressure of 700 psi ( 4 . 8 mpa ) was needed to maintain a flow rate of 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 liter / min . a further test was conducted to study the differences in the extrusion properties of liposomes with respect to the orientation of the 100 nm anopore \u2122 branched - pore filter used to size reduce the liposomes . as discussed above , the anopore 0 . 1 um branched - pore filter has a small - pore side , having 100 nm pores , and a large - pore side , having 200 nm pores . in this test , a comparison was made to determine the effects of passing aliquots of the same liposome material through the 100 nm anopore filters with the small - pore side upstream or with the large - pore side upstream . the test was performed using egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol liposomes , made in accordance with example 1 , with the liposomes in aqueous suspension at 100 mg / ml . the material was prepared in a single - five liter lot , mixed well , and divided into four 750 ml samples ( a - d ). samples a and b were extruded using the 100 - nm upstream orientation , and samples c and d used the 200 - nm upstream orientation . extrusion of the liposomes was carried out by passing them twice though the branched - pore filters , under 400 psig ( 2 . 8 mpa ) pressure . the particle size distributions of the filtered materials from each of the test samples were measured using a nicomp \u2122 sizer , as described in example 2 , and found to be generally equivalent . however , the time required to size reduce the liposomes was significantly less for samples a and b , with the 100 - nm filter side upstream , as opposed to samples c and d , with the 200 - nm filter side upstream . table v presents the mean particle size diameter in nanometers ( nm ) and the filtration time in minutes ( min ): the extruded material was then sterile filtered through a 220 - nm sterilization filter , of the same type used in the comparative example . the sterilization filter used in this test , and in the above comparative example , was a commercially available millipak \u2122 200 filter supplied by millipore corp ., bedford , mass , and described as having a durapore \u2122 polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) tortuous path membrane . sterile filtration was considered complete when all of the material had passed through the sterilization filter , or when the steady stream of material had broken into a slow drip . the mean particle diameter ( nm ), the time required to pass through the filter ( min ), and the percent volume of material which passed through the sterilization filter were measured for each sample , and the results are presented in table vi : these data demonstrate that the sterile filtration was very efficient for samples a and b , in which almost all of the material successfully passed through the sterilization filter . in contrast , only about half of the volume of samples c and d was able to pass through the sterilization filter before the flow stopped . fig1 is a simplified top view , not to scale , of a filter assembly ( 10 ) made in accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention , designed for use with a 90 - mm diameter anopore \u2122 filer . it should also be recognized that this filter assembly could also be used to house other types of filters as well , such as , for example , the nuclepore \u2122 filters used in the comparative tests in example iii above . fig2 is a simplified cross - sectional side view , not to scale , of figure assembly ( 10 ) cut along line 2 \u2014 2 of fig1 . filter assembly ( 10 ) comprises a filter housing top half ( 11 ) and a filter housing bottom half ( 12 ), held together by a plurality of fastening screws ( 13 ). referring to fig2 filter unit ( 14 ) represents a 90 - mm anopore filter mounted on a drain disk ( nuclepore catalog # 231700 ) cut to 90 mm , which is in turn mounted on a 90 - mm teflon r coated mesh filter support ( millipore catalog # yy30 090 54 ). filter unit ( 14 ) is in turn mounted on a stainless steel filter support plate ( 15 ), which is provided with fluid passage means , such as transverse channels ( 16 ). support plate ( 15 ) sits into a seat portion ( 17 ) of filter housing bottom half ( 12 ), with the seat portion ( 17 ) provided with radial grooves ( not shown ) to channel the liquid which passes through the filter into liquid outlet ( 18 ). filter housing top half ( 11 ) includes a ring portion ( 19 ) which holds filter unit ( 14 ) in place when top half ( 11 ) is tightened down onto bottom half ( 12 ) by screws ( 13 ). in operation , the liquid to be filtered enters filter assembly ( 10 ) through liquid inlet ( 20 ), flows through filter unit ( 14 ) and filter support plate ( 15 ), and then is channeled out through filter outlet ( 18 ). preferably , housing top half ( 11 ) is provided with a relief outlet ( 21 ), by which a relief valve ( not shown ) can be connected to the housing . although filter assembly ( 10 ) has been described in terms of a \u201c top half \u201d and a \u201c bottom half \u201d, these references are for purposes of describing the structure , and do not reflect the orientation of the housing in operation . because the liquid being filtered is sent to the assembly at such relatively high pressures , it is believed that the assembly can be used in any orientation . fig3 is a schematic representation of an extrusion system made in accordance with the present invention . the liposome composition to be filtered is contained in a high pressure supply vessel ( 31 ), and the filtrate is collected in a similar receiving vessel ( 32 ). both of these vessels are shown as being equipped with stirrers to maintain the liposome mixtures , and heat jacketed for temperature control . the liquid exits supply vessel ( 31 ) through a bottom outlet , and is carried through a one or more filter assemblies ( 33 ), of the type described above , containing 90 - mm anopore \u2122 filters . the filter assemblies ( 33 ) are connected in parallel , with the number of such assemblies used determined by the desired total flow rate from supply vessel ( 31 ) to receiving vessel ( 32 ). from receiving vessel ( 32 ), the filtrate is forced through a sterilization filter ( 35 ), such as a millipak \u2122 200 filter as described in example 4 above , and is then collected in a stirred holding vessel ( 36 ). in addition , a recycle line ( 34 ) may be provided to allow a portion of the output of receiving vessel ( 32 ) to be recycled to supply vessel ( 31 ). the terms and expressions which have been employed are used as terms of description and not of limitation , and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof , but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed ."}

to sports shoes , but rather it is to be understood that the present invention can also be used to improve the foot climate of any article of footwear . further , only a left or right sole and / or shoe is depicted in any given figure ; however , it is to be understood that the left and right soles / shoes are typically mirror images of each other and the description applies to both left and right soles / shoes . generally , a sole in accordance with the invention includes at least three layers that may include several function specific components . each of the layers has one or more openings disposed therein , such that ventilation and air exchange may occur within the shoe , thus improving the climate properties of the shoe . the one or more openings in each layer partially overlap the openings in the adjacent layer when the shoe sole is fully assembled . by the arrangement of the three or more layers with openings that only partially overlap , a substantially greater number of openings can be provided in the insole layer without reducing the mechanical stability of the shoe . as a result , the heat and humidity generated can be removed directly from the foot sole much more quickly than with conventional shoe designs . a sole 100 in accordance with the invention is shown in fig1 . the sole 100 includes a support layer 10 arranged below an insole layer 1 and an outsole layer 30 arranged below the support layer 10 . the insole layer 1 includes a plurality of openings 2 , 3 and can act as a cushioning layer for the sole 100 . the support layer 10 may be

102 of a shoe 101 can be attached to the sole 100 , as best seen in fig1 . the insole layer 1 is depicted in fig2 and includes a plurality of generally circularly shaped openings 2 , 3 . alternatively , the openings 2 , 3 may have a shape other than circular , for example square , rectangular , elliptical , or any combination thereof . the openings 2 , 3 may be distributed over substantially the entire area of the insole layer 1 . generally , the openings 3 have a greater open area than the openings 2 to optimize the permeability of the insole layer 1 for air and humidity transfer . further , in order to avoid excessive local pressure on the foot sole and at the same time provide adequate ventilation , the openings 2 of the insole layer 1 are preferably smaller in the heel region 6 and / or the ball region 7 of the insole layer 1 . in one embodiment , the diameter of the openings 2 in these regions is only about 2 mm to about 3 mm , whereas the diameter of the openings 3 in the remaining regions of the insole layer 1 is about 4 mm to about 5 mm . in other embodiments , the openings 2 located in the heel region 6 and / or the ball region 7 may be substantially smaller than

channels 4 , 5 are used . the channels 4 , 5 can be arranged on the top side 15 or the bottom side 14 of the insole layer 1 or can even be integrated into the insole layer 1 . it has been found , however , that in order to avoid excessive friction between the foot sole and the insole layer 1 , and for reasons associated with the manufacture of the insole layer 1 , an arrangement on the bottom side 14 is typically beneficial . in one embodiment , most of the larger openings 3 are connected to their respective next opening 3 only by a single channel 5 and the smaller openings 2 are interconnected by a grid - like pattern of crossing channels 4 . not all openings 2 , 3 need to be connected to other openings 2 , 3 . the insole layer 1 can be manufactured by , for example , injection molding or extrusion . extrusion processes may be used to provide a uniform shape . insert molding can then be used to provide the desired geometry of the open spaces , or the open spaces could be created in the desired locations by a subsequent machining operation . the insole layer 1 can be manufactured from any suitable polymeric material or combination of polymeric materials , either with or without reinforcement . suitable materials include polyurethanes ( pu ), such as a thermoplastic polyurethane ( tpu ), ethylene vinyl acetate ( eva ), or other comparatively soft material . other suitable materials will be apparent to those skilled in the art . by the repeated compression of the insole layer 1 from the mechanical loading of the shoe 101 during ground contact , a pumping action is caused , which quickly transports the humidity surrounding the foot sole down to the support layer 10 . for example , in the case of extreme physical activity , such as during a basketball game , hot and humid air develops below the foot sole in the interior of the shoe . in shoe soles 100 according to the present invention , the hot and humid air is transported through the openings 2 , 3 down to the support layer 10 . the network of channels 4 , 5 arranged on the bottom side 14 of the insole layer 1 allow a fast horizontal diffusion of the humidity to the adjacent openings 11 , 12 in the support layer 10 . this diffusion is facilitated by the repeated compression of the channels 4 , 5 on the bottom side 14 of the insole layer 1 , which act as small pumps . referring to fig1 , and 4 , the support layer 10 , together with the additional support element 20 , forms a frame or chassis around which the shoe 101 is built . the support layer 10 , in part , determines the mechanical properties of the shoe in which it is used , such as the response of the shoe to loads arising during a particular sport . the support layer 10 includes a forefoot part 21 having a generally planar shape and a rearfoot part 22 that three - dimensionally encompasses the heel of a wearer &# 39 ; s foot , thereby providing support . in one particular embodiment , the support layer 10 extends into the heel region 6 and the ball region 7 of the sole 100 to withstand particularly high mechanical loading on shoes in these areas during repeated ground contact and push - off motions . in addition , a plurality of openings 11 can be arranged in the toe region 9 and / or the arch region 8 of the sole 100 so as not to degrade the support provided by the support layer 10 . additional longitudinal supports 13 can be used to reinforce the stability of the support layer 10 in the toe region 9 , and struts 14 can be used to reinforce the support layer 10 in the arch region 8 . in addition , lateral flanges 24 can be provided on the support layer 10 with openings 12 to contribute to ventilation of the interior of the shoe 101 . the openings 11 , 12 are formed by a series of closely spaced , generally parallel bands or ribs 27 that form a grill or cage pattern and provide a moisture and air pervious structure . as best seen in fig1 b , the ribs 27 are generally circularly shaped and have a diameter of about 1 mm to about 2 mm and a spacing of about 2 mm to about 3 mm . the grill pattern is used to achieve a very low resistance to the flow of humidity and hot air while also maintaining the greatest stability of the sole 100 . alternatively , the openings 11 , 12 could be circular , rectangular , elliptical , or any combination thereof . the distribution of the openings 11 , 12 may affect the mechanical properties of the support layer 10 . for example , in one embodiment of the sole 100 , no openings are provided in the heel region 6 and the ball region 7 of the sole 100 , because these two regions of the sole 100 require a high degree of support in order to avoid excessive pronation or supination of the wearer &# 39 ; s foot . when the insole layer 1 is arranged on top of the support layer 10 , the hot and humid air coming down through the openings 2 , 3 can pass through the openings 11 , 12 in the support layer 10 . the majority of the openings 2 , 3 in the toe region 9 and the arch region 8 directly overlap with the openings 11 , 12 of the support layer 10 . the greatest density of the foot &# 39 ; s sweat pores are located in the toe region 9 and the arch region 8 of the wearer &# 39 ; s foot , therefore , openings in the sole 100 corresponding to those regions furthers the downward guidance of the hot and humid air . the humidity developing in the heel region 6 and the ball region 7 is at first \u201c pumped \u201d through the channels 4 , 5 along the bottom side 14 of the insole layer 1 , i . e ., along the upper side of the support layer 10 , until the closest opening 11 , 12 in the support layer 10 is reached . the support layer 10 can be manufactured by , for example , injection molding or extrusion . extrusion processes may be used to provide a uniform shape , such as a single monolithic frame . insert molding can then be used to provide the desired geometry of the open spaces , or the open spaces could be created in the desired locations by a subsequent machining operation . other manufacturing techniques include melting or bonding portions together . for example , the lateral flanges 24 may be adhered to the support layer 10 with a liquid epoxy or a hot melt adhesive , such as ( eva ). in addition to adhesive bonding , portions can be solvent bonded , which entails using a solvent to facilitate fusing of the portions . the support layer 10 can be manufactured out of substantially compression resistant plastic materials , which have the advantage of withstanding the mechanical loads arising during contact of the shoe with the ground and also have the required flexibility not to hinder movements of the foot , such as those that occur during the rolling - off and pushing - off phase of the gait cycle . in particular , the support layer 10 can be manufactured from any suitable polymeric material or combination of polymeric materials , either with or without reinforcement . suitable materials include : polyurethanes , such as a thermoplastic polyurethane ( tpu ); eva ; thermoplastic polyether block amides , such as the pebax \u00ae brand sold by elf atochem ; thermoplastic polyester elastomers , such as the hytrel \u00ae brand sold by dupont ; polyamides , such as nylon 12 , which may include 10 to 30 percent or more glass fiber reinforcement ; silicones ; polyethylenes ; and equivalent materials . reinforcement , if used , may be by inclusion of glass or carbon graphite fibers or para - aramid fibers , such as the kevlar \u00ae brand sold by dupont , or other similar method . also , the polymeric materials may be used in combination with other materials , for example rubber . other suitable materials will be apparent to those skilled in the art . the specific materials used will depend on the particular application for which the shoe is designed , but generally should be sufficiently compression - resistant , supportive , and flexible to the extent necessary for a particular sport . the support layer 10 can be reinforced by a support element 20 disposed in the arch region 8 of the sole 100 . the support element 20 can be an open frame construction with a plurality of openings 23 , which may correspond to the openings 11 , 12 and the struts 14 of the support layer 10 . the support element 20 can affect the resistance of the sole 100 to foot movements , for example torsional movements of the forefoot with respect to the rearfoot . the support element can also control the longitudinal stiffness of the shoe 101 . the exact configuration of the support layer 10 and support element 20 can be varied to accommodate numerous applications . for example , different embodiments of the support layer 10 and / or the support element 20 will be used to customize the sole 100 and / or the shoe 101 for a particular activity . in addition , the support element 20 may be secured to the support layer 10 by adhesive bonding , solvent bonding , mechanical retention , or similar techniques . various alternative embodiments of the support layer 10 , 110 , 210 , the support element 20 , 120 , 220 , and the outsole layer 30 , 130 , 230 are schematically illustrated in fig5 to 8 . the support element 20 can be manufactured in any of the manners and materials as described hereinabove for the support layer 10 . although in the embodiment shown in fig1 the support layer 10 and the support element 20 are shown as separate components of the sole 100 , an integrated alternative is possible . for example , the support layer 10 and any support elements 20 can be produced as an integral component by dual injection molding . referring again to fig1 , and 4 , the outsole layer 30 is positioned below the support layer 10 and any additional support elements 20 . in the embodiment shown in fig1 the outsole layer 30 includes a forefoot part 31 and a rearfoot part 32 . the weight of the shoe 101 is reduced by the absence of any outsole material in the arch region 8 of the sole 100 . in addition , large recesses or openings 33 , 34 , 35 are disposed in the outsole layer 30 to facilitate the dispersion of the hot and humid air from the interior of the shoe 101 via the openings 11 , 12 in the support layer 10 to the outside air . essentially , the openings 33 , 34 , 35 do not affect the damping properties of the outsole layer 30 . the openings 33 , 34 , 35 are positioned such that they generally correspond with the openings 11 , 12 of the supporting layer 10 ; however , the openings 33 , 34 , 35 can be positioned to accommodate a particular application . because of the thickness of the outsole layer 30 , which is in the range of about 0 . 5 centimeters ( cm ) to about 2 cm , the openings 11 , 12 of the support layer 10 are not in direct contact with the ground . accordingly , this prevents humidity ( water vapor and / or fluid ) from easily entering the interior of the shoe 101 . if the shoe 101 is not used exclusively for indoor sports , then a breathable membrane 26 can be provided for complete watertightness . the breathable membrane 26 may be positioned between the support layer 10 and the insole layer 1 . the breathable membrane 26 may be made out of a breathable , but watertight , material that may further improve the climate properties of the shoe 101 , for example the gore - tex \u00ae brand sold by w . l . gore & amp ; associates . the sole 100 includes enough openings arranged above and below the membrane 26 that the breathing properties of the membrane 26 are effective without endangering the overall stability of the shoe 101 . furthermore , the grill - like openings 11 , 12 of the support layer 10 protect the membrane 26 against damage from below . further , the membrane 26 prevents stones or dirt from entering the interior of the shoe 101 and , thereby prevents deterioration of the ventilation properties of the shoe 101 by clogged or closed openings . in the case of sports with high lateral loading , for example basketball , the outsole layer 30 can extend upwards over the edge of the sole 100 , as shown in fig4 . such an arrangement cushions against lateral ground contacts . in addition , the flexibility of the outsole layer 30 can be improved by strategically positioning one or more grooves 36 in the outsole layer 30 , for example to facilitate an easier rolling - off phase of the gait cycle . fig5 to 8 depict alternative embodiments of the outsole layer 30 , 130 , 230 . in the case of a sport such as tennis , which requires a high degree of lateral stability due to strong lateral loading , the embodiment shown in fig5 may be used advantageously . the traction properties of the sole 100 may be enhanced by the addition of a tread layer 40 below the outsole layer 30 . depending on the particular application , different materials can be used , such as tpu or suitable rubber mixtures that simultaneously provide high abrasion resistance and good traction . the shape of the tread layer 40 typically corresponds to the outsole layer 30 so that the ventilation properties of the sole 101 are not affected by the function specific selection of a suitable tread layer 40 . the tread layer 40 can also extend sideways over the edge of the sole 100 to improve grip during lateral ground contact of the foot . additionally , the outsole layer 30 can include a cushioning layer 70 to enhance the damping properties of the sole 100 . the outsole layer 30 , the tread layer 40 , and the cushioning layer 70 can be manufactured by any of the methods disclosed herein . in addition , the outsole layer 30 , the tread layer 40 , and the cushioning layer 70 can be manufactured from any of the materials described herein to suit their particular application . for example , the arrangement and materials used in the outsole layer 30 can affect the damping properties of the shoe 101 . as such , foamed materials , such as pu , eva , and like elastomeric materials , are recommended . these materials are subjected to a strong compression set during the course of their manufacture , such that they permanently keep their elastic damping properties even under high mechanical loading . with respect to the cushioning layer 70 , comparatively soft materials , such as pu or eva , are recommended . athletic shoes used in sports with many jumps and frequent changes of direction , for example basketball , typically extend upwards over the ankle joint to support the joint and protect against injuries . in one embodiment , the shoe 101 includes a flexible net - like protection element 60 , which is shown in fig9 in an unfolded position and in fig1 in its position proximate the ankle area 62 of the shoe 101 . in the finished shoe 101 , the element 60 is typically covered by a suitable air permeable fabric or mesh . the protection element 60 is made out of a flexible material , for example eva or a material based on a silicone elastomer . alternatively , other soft thermoplastic materials or a pu can be used . the protection element 60 is manufactured in a generally planar configuration and is folded or otherwise manipulated into shape and then secured in place within the shoe 101 . alternatively , the protection element 60 can be directly three - dimensionally shaped , for example by injection molding or other suitable techniques , and then bonded to the shoe 101 and / or sole 100 . the protection element 60 includes a plurality of openings 61 that improve the air permeability of this area of the shoe 101 . the shape and dimensions of the openings 61 will vary to suit a particular application . the dimensions are in the range of about 2 mm to about 4 mm , up to about 1 cm . the shape of the openings 61 can be circular , rectangular , elliptical , or any combination thereof . in the embodiment shown on fig9 and 10 , the openings 61 have an essentially rectangular shape . the protection element 60 provides good support and protection for the ankle joint , as well as improved ventilation of the interior of the shoe 101 , because it replaces commonly used denser materials . similar protection elements can also be used in other parts of the upper 102 , for example in the instep region 64 where excessive pressure may be caused by a lacing system 65 ( fig1 ) of the shoe 101 , without reducing the air permeability of the upper 102 . [ 0055 ] fig1 depicts a shoe 101 and sock 103 assembly according to one aspect of the invention . the shoe 101 includes an upper 102 and a sole 100 in accordance with the invention . the upper 102 can be a reinforced mesh material that includes bands or members 108 that are anchored to the sole 100 . the members 108 can provide the structural support for the lacing system 65 . the upper 102 can be attached to an edge of the sole &# 39 ; s support layer 10 by gluing , stitching , or other suitable techniques . alternatively , the upper 102 can be any known type or configuration of an upper . the upper 102 shown includes a lacing system 65 , which can be any conventional lacing system , such as laces or a hook and loop type fastener , such as the velcro \u00ae brand sold by velcro industries b . v . the special sock 103 functions to improve the climate properties of the shoe 101 when used in combination with the sole 100 . the sock 103 , together with the sole 100 , forms an overall system that determines the thermophysiological conditions a foot is subjected to . these conditions are defined by the heat and steam transmission resistances , the steam or water absorption / emission , and the friction forces of the surfaces of the sock and the shoe . in one embodiment , the sock 103 includes a two layer mesh construction having an inside layer 104 with good diffusion properties and an outsole layer 105 with good absorption properties . the good diffusion properties of the insole layer 104 cause the sweat generated by the foot to be immediately transferred away from the skin to the outer layer 105 , for example by capillary wicking . the outside layer &# 39 ; s good absorption properties act as a storage for the humidity before it is transported to the ambient air through the openings in the layers of the sole 100 . these particular properties of the sock 103 can be achieved by using synthetic fiber materials , such as the polycolon \u00ae brand sold by sch\u00f6ller , the dacron \u00ae brand sold by dupont , or the rhoa \u00ae- sport brand sold by rhodia . a shoe in accordance with the invention was compared to a conventional shoe , the results of which are represented by the graphs shown in fig1 a and 12 b . as can be seen , the shoe in accordance with the invention has substantially improved ventilation properties as compared to the conventional shoe . the testing was performed using a foot climate measuring sock , which made it possible to determine how fast humidity developing in the interior of the shoe is transported to the outside through the sole and the upper . a foot climate measuring sock is a cotton or polyester sock provided with capacitive sensors for measuring humidity and additional sensors for measuring temperature . since the sensors are very thin , they are not felt by the wearer of the sock . the data measured by the sensors is sent to a personal computer where the humidity and temperature results are analyzed . [ 0058 ] fig1 a shows the measurements taken during an approximately twenty - five minute test on a tread mill with a person wearing a shoe in accordance with the invention . the results are plotted on a graph where the y - axis represents the humidity index as measured in millivolts ( mv ) and the x - axis represents the length of the test as measured in hours , minutes , and seconds . the increase in humidity in the interior of the shoe is reflected in the increasing voltage plotted along the y - axis and represented as 110 . the graph represents a slow , generally linear increase from approximately 170 mv to approximately 400 mv , i . e ., an increase of about 330 mv over a period of about twenty - five minutes . [ 0059 ] fig1 b depicts the results of the same experiment , but performed with a person wearing a conventional sports shoe . note the scaling of the y - axis is different in the graph shown in fig1 b than in fig1 a . accordingly , to best illustrate the significant improvement of the inventive shoe , the voltage plot 110 of fig1 b is manually overlaid on the graph of 12 b . as can be seen , the voltage 120 , which is proportional to the humidity in the interior of the conventional shoe , rises rapidly from approximately 150 mv to approximately 800 mv , i . e ., an increase of about 650 mv over a similar twenty - five minute period . therefore , shoes in accordance with the invention reduce the increase in humidity in the shoe interior by almost 100 % with respect to conventional shoes . this result corresponds to reports by test subjects who noticed the improved foot climate properties of the inventive shoes , as compared to the conventional shoes . having described certain embodiments of the invention , it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments incorporating the concepts disclosed herein may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention . the described embodiments are to be considered in all respects as only illustrative and not restrictive ."}

rigid . apparatus 10 manufactured in this manner is a single - use disposable article . to use apparatus 10 for flossing teeth , thimble 12 is inserted over the tip of any finger or thumb . since some manipulation of the finger or thumb within the mouth is necessary during flossing with apparatus 10 , the preferred finger used for flossing with apparatus 10 is the index finger , as most users have better control of their index fingers . thimble 12 is sized such that a fairly tight fit results with the finger is inserted therein , and the elasticity of thimble 12 serve to better grip thimble around the tip of the finger . a vacuum is also created after insertion of the finger into thimble 12 , which further aids in securely holding thimble 12 onto the finger or thumb . once thimble 12 is in place over the finger or thumb tips , apparatus 10 is maneuvered within the mouth so that dental floss 18 can be slid between teeth for flossing action . various other means for supporting dental floss 18 on thimble 12 are also contemplated . these alternative attachment means provide for the removal and replacement of dental floss 18 , thus rendering apparatus 10 reusable . for example , as shown in fig3 through fig6 an alternative embodiment and a second alternative embodiment of apparatus 10 is generally shown . dental floss 18 can include gripper handles 30a , 30b as shown in fig3 or gripper handles 32a , 32b , as shown in fig5 and fig6 which are disposed at each end of the dental floss as taught in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 016 , 892 , which is incorporated herein by reference . the gripper handles can be spherical as shown in fig3 elongated as shown in fig5 and fig6 or any other shape ( e . g ., hex , triangular , star - shaped , etc .) that is desired and convenient for attachment and use . to accommodate dental floss 18 having gripper handles , a channel or slot 34a , 34b is disposed adjacent each tip 20a , 20b of tines 14a , 14b . each slot 34a , 34b preferably has an opening 36a , 36b for the insertion of dental floss 18 therein . slots 34a , 34b and openings 36a , 36b are sized to receive and allow passage of dental floss 18 therethrough . to prevent dental floss 18 from slipping off during flossing , slots 34a , 34b preferably follow an arced or curvilinear path from openings 36a , 36b to receptacles 38a , 38b , respectively , which receive the gripper handles . in the embodiments shown , receptacles 38a , 38b are semi - spherical depressions to receive spherical gripper handles , but it will be appreciated that neither the shape of the gripper handles nor that of the receptacles is limited . in the embodiment shown in fig3 tines 14a , 14b are preferably sufficiently flexible that they can be flexed toward each other for attachment of dental floss 18 , and dental floss 18 preferably has a length slightly less than the distance between tips 20a , 20b when tines 14a , 14b are in a relaxed position ( no floss installed ). receptacles 38a , 38b are sized to be smaller than gripper handles 30a , 30b to prevent passage of gripper handles 30a , 30b therethrough . as dental floss 18 is placed in receptacles 38a , 38b , tines 14a , 14b are flexed toward each other . the tendency for tines 14a , 14b to return to their relaxed position serves to maintain constant tautness on dental floss 18 necessary for flossing . in the second alternative embodiment shown in fig5 and fig6 gripper handles 32a , 32b are inserted into receptacles 40a , 40b , respectively , as shown . receptacles 40a , 40b are disposed on wall 24 of thimble 12 below tines 14a , 14b , respectively . receptacles 40a , 40b are sized to snugly receive gripper handles 32a , 32b therein and to securely maintain said handles in place during flossing . the length of dental floss 18 , in conjunction with the position of receptacles 40a , 40a provides for tautness of dental floss 18 when placed on apparatus 10 . it will be appreciated that the means for suspending dental floss between the tines shown in fig3 and fig4 and between the tine and the thimble shown in fig5 and fig6 could be combined . for example , a hybrid could be configured where one gripper handle is retained by the tip of a tine as in fig3 while the other gripper handle fits into a receptacle in the thimble as shown in fig6 . referring also to fig7 and fig8 a third alternative embodiment 42 of the present invention is generally shown wherein still another means for supporting dental floss 18 from thimble can be seen . a single tine 14a extends from the distal end 16 of thimble 12 and dental floss 18 is suspended between tip 20a of tine 14a and thimble 12 . tine 14a is typically angled or curved , as shown in fig7 to better allow for the vertical suspension of dental floss 18 , and is preferably centered as shown in fig8 . dental floss 18 can be attached to either wall 24 or distal end 16 of thimble 12 . dental floss 18 is preferably fixedly attached to both tip 20a of tine 14a and thimble 12 during manufacture by an injection molding process . this embodiment is particularly well suited to flossing anterior teeth such as rear molars . it will also be appreciated that , as an alternative , dental floss with gripper handles could be used . here , the tip of the tine would be configured similarly to that shown in the alternative embodiment of fig3 and fig4 and the receptacle in the thimble would be like that shown in second alternative embodiment of fig6 . referring now to fig9 and fig1 , a fourth alternative embodiment of a dental flossing apparatus is generally shown . here , a second thimble 46 is used in conjunction with thimble 12 to allow for additional torque control and leverage during flossing . second thimble 46 is placed in tandem with thimble 12 and connected thereto by a bridge 48 . second thimble includes an opening 50 , a band 52 peripherally disposed around opening 50 , a tapered wall 54 extending from opening 50 and a convex - shaped distal end 56 . bridge 48 is attached to wall 24 of thimble 12 and wall 54 of second thimble 46 . tines 14a , 14b is fixedly attached and extends from distal end 16 of thimble 12 , as also shown in the first embodiment . it is also contemplated that tines 14a , 14b can extend from distal end 56 of second thimble 46 . it is further contemplated that tine 14a may extend from thimble 12 while tine 14b may extend from second thimble 46 . tines 14a , 14b are formed with thimbles 12 , 46 during manufacturing preferably by an injection molding process . the additional of second thimble 46 in tandem to thimble 12 permits two adjacent fingers to be used to floss which increases the user &# 39 ; s torque control and leverage especially when flossing hard to reach areas within the mouth . referring also to fig1 , a fifth alternative embodiment 58 of a dental flossing apparatus is generally shown . in this embodiment , a finger holder 60 is attached in tandem to thimble 12 by bridge 48 . finger holder 60 comprises a semi -

{"publication_number": "US-2001043956-A1", "abstract": "a cure for a hangover containing the active ingredient ephedrine in powdered form enclosed in a capsule . in a second embodiment this cure contains ephedrine and charcoal , while in a third embodiment , this cure contains ephedra , charcoal and vitamin b6 . the use of any one of the three embodiments reduces the symptoms associated with alcohol intoxication and hangovers thereby speeding up recovery . the ephedra , vitamin b - 6 and charcoal may be combined on a wt . % ratio of 1 : 2 . 5 : 10 . the ephedra may come in the form of ma

would be two capsules so that users who are experiencing a hangover or alcohol related side effects may take up to 20 mg of ephedra , 50 mg of vitamin b - 6 and 200 mg of activated charcoal . this cure may also consist of a therapeutic method for curing the effects of alcohol consumption wherein this dosage could be taken after the consumption of alcohol .", "application_number": "US-78890301-A", "description": "essentially , the invention relates to a hangover cure for persons who have ingested alcohol . the alcohol functions as a vasodilator , which means that when it is added to the bloodstream , it causes a dilation effect on the blood vessels . when added to the alcohol rich blood system , ephedra counteracts the effects of alcohol by acting as a vasoconstrictor thereby decreasing the size of the blood vessels , and relieving the perceived pressure on the brain . ephedrine , which is an extract of ephedra , is the nonproprietary name for the chemical substance - 2 - methylamino - 1 - phenylpropanol - 01 and while it is not regulated as a controlled substance under the controlled substances act ( csa ), it is listed as a chemical under that law . however , small doses of l - ephedrine are available off the shelf . one of the most common forms is ma huang a chinese herb sold over the counter in nutrition and vitamin stores . ephedrine is used as a stimulant and a bronchodilator and is chemically similar to drugs in the amphetamine group . it functions as a main ingredient in legally available energizers , nutritional suppliments , and dietary teas . essentially , ephedrine triggers a mild burst of energy when ingested into the body . in addition to the stimulant effects , which can include feelings of alertness and reduced appetite , ephedrine also relaxes bronchial muscles and dilates airways , and can cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate . a synthetic form of the drug pseudoephedrine is found in over the counter and prescription cold and allergy products . charcoal is also used to help a person recover from a hangover because it functions as an adsorbent . adsorbents are chemically inert powders that have the ability to adsorb gasses , toxins , and bacteria usually in the gastrointestinal tract . charcoal is widely considered to be the emergency treatment of choice for virtually all drug and chemical poisoning . the adsorptive properties of charcoal can be greatly increased by treating it with various substances such as steam , air , carbon dioxide , oxygen , zinc chloride , sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid or a combination of some other substances at a temperature ranging from 500 degrees fahrenheit to 900 degrees fahrenheit . this treatment is commonly referred to as activation wherein the activating agent presumably removes substances previously adsorbed on the charcoal and , breaks down the granules of carbon into smaller ones having a greater surface area . for example , it has been estimated that one milliliter of charcoal has a surface area of 1000 m 2 . in addition to wood , many other substances can be used as a source for charcoal such as , sucrose , lactose , rice starch , coconut pericarp , bone , blood , various industrial wastes . the end product is a fine black odorless and tasteless powder that is free from gritty matter that is insoluble in water or other known solvents . furthermore , another supplement to this cure is vitamin b6 , also known as pyridoxine . this vitamin is involved in the formation of body protein and structural compounds , chemical transmitters in the nervous system , red blood cells , and prostaglandins . in addition , vitamin b6 is also important in maintaining hormonal balance and proper immune function . deficiency in vitamin b6 is characterized by depression , convulsions , glucose intolerance , anemia , impaired nerve function , cracking of the lips and tongue and seborrhea or eczema . those with the following health conditions : asthma , premenstrual syndrome , carpal tunnel syndrome , depression , morning sickness , and kidney stones reported positive responses when they supplemented their diet with vitamin b6 . because vitamin b6 is especially helpful in reducing nervous disorders , it forms a beneficial compliment to the effect of alcohol on the nervous system . in the following examples , the indicated compositions are intended for three separate embodiments . these compositions could be taken in the form of a capsule , a pill , or other forms of ingestion such as a drink containing the active ingredients . example 1 ma huang ( 6 wt % ephedra ) 334 mg elcema g - 250 powder cellulose 54 mg captex 300 8 mg magnesium stearate lubricant 2 mg sipernat 50s 2 mg the first embodiment of the invention is a 400 mg capsule that contains 334 mg of ma huang extract containing 6 wt . % ephedra ( approximately 20 mg of ephedra ), 54 mg of elcema g - 250 powder cellulose for binding , 8mg of captex 300 to aid in the encapsulation , 2mg of magnesium stearate lubricant , and 2mg of sipernat 50s as a flow aid . as stated above , the ephedra functions as a vasoconstrictor counteracting the effects of alcohol in the bloodstream . in addition , because alcohol can also act as a depressant on the body , the stimulating quality of ephedra also functions to counteract this side effect . furthermore , since ephedra acts as a decongestant , it also relieves the congestive symptoms commonly associated with hangovers . example 2 ma huang ( 6 wt % ephedra extract ) 167 mg charcoal 100 mg elcema g - 250 powder cellulose for 46 mg binding captex 300 8 mg magnesium stearate 2 mg sipernat 50s 2 mg the second embodiment of the invention is a 325 mg capsule that contains 167 mg of ma huang extract powder containing 6 % ephedra ( approximately 10 mg of ephedra ), 100 mg of charcoal , 46 mg of elcema g - 250 powder cellulose for binding , 8 mg captex 300 to aid in the encapsulation , 2 mg of magnesium stearate lubricant , and 2 mg of sipernat 50 s as a flow aid . in this case , the addition of the charcoal allows this dosage to function with greater headache relief because the carbon in the charcoal acts as a detoxification agent by extracting impurities in the intestinal system from the introduction of alcohol moving them to the large intestine for removal . furthermore , the addition of charcoal as an adsorbent in the digestive system will also relieve diarrhea , flatulence , and acidity in the stomach , symptoms that are common to most hangovers . example 3 ma huang ( 6 wt % ephedra extract ) 167 mg charcoal 100 mg vitamin b - 6 ( pyridoxine ) 25 mg elcema g - 250 powder cellulose for 46 mg binding captex 300 8 mg magnesium stearate 2 mg sipernat 50s 2 mg a third embodiment of the invention is a 350 mg capsule that is similar to the second embodiment but contains an additional 25 mg of vitamin b - 6 . in this case , the 25 mg of vitamin b6 is added to the capsule so that when it is adsorbed into the bloodstream , it helps to counteract any harmful side effects of alcohol in the bloodstream . for example , alcohol functions as a diuretic depleting a person &# 39 ; s body of water soluble vitamins and minerals . thus , because vitamin b - 6 is water soluble , a person experiencing a hangover may have relatively low levels of vitamin b - 6 . therefore , by adding vitamin b - 6 or any other type of water soluble vitamin , a person may recover from a hangover at a faster rate . all three of these embodiments are preferably presented in capsule form . in this way , the active ingredients of ephedrine , charcoal and vitamin b - 6 can be presented in powder form to enter the bloodstream more rapidly . once the capsule has been ingested , the gelatin outer coating breaks down and the powdered active and non - toxic ingredients that break down within the digestive system of a person and enter their blood stream . the solution shown in example 3 was used in a double blind randomized parallel study comparing the test product in example 3 to a placebo . thirty four volunteers between the ages of 21 and 45 were invited to participate in the study . after signing a consent form and answering questions on a questionnaire relating to their demographic characteristics , drinking habits and state of health , the volunteers were entered into the study . all of the volunteers followed the same procedure for the study . volunteers reported at the study site which was a hotel and signed the consent form . these volunteers were then examined by a physician and vital signs were then taken . upon approval to enter the study , a bal reading was taken , and the volunteers were free to drink at an open bar , and partake of a food buffet . the bar was open until 2 a . m . on saturday . at their discretion , volunteers went to their designated hotel room to sleep , after having vital signs taken , responding to a questionnaire relating to their symptoms , taking a physical sobriety exam administered by a physician , and taking a bal test . they were instructed not to have any alcohol after leaving the study premises , and to report for breakfast the following morning at 8 a . m . the following morning , the subjects were examined by a physician , wherein vital signs and bal were taken . the subjects then answered a questionnaire relating to their symptoms . next , the study drugs were then administered wherein there were 2 capsules of the test drug or placebo used in a double blind fashion . the two different drugs were applied across a random group using the answers to the questionnaire to equalize the frequency of the active drug and the placebo with patients having similar answers on the questionnaire . volunteers were then asked to have breakfast wherein no caffinated foods or beverages were served . at periods of one and two hours after the initial exam , the volunteers repeated the original procedure consisting of an examination by the physician , a reading of vital signs and a blood alcohol level ( bal ) reading . they then answered the same questionnaire relating to their symptoms . thus , the data was available at a baseline test at approximately 8 a . m . when the test products were first given , and then at one and two hour intervals following the administration of the test products . to determine the effects of the drugs repeated measures analysis of variance were performed on the percentage change in score from baseline at one and two hours after study products were administered . the baseline score was used to covariate . each of the five questions on the questionnaire was scored from 1 to 3 with 1 equaling an absence of a symptom and 3 equaling a severe symptom . thus , the total score for each participant could either equal 5 which is a complete absence of symptoms or 15 wherein all symptoms are severe . the reported scores of the active group receiving the dosage according to example 3 , and the placebo group receiving a placebo dosage are shown in table 1 below . based upon this test and the analysis of the results , the volunteers on the active product showed symptom improvement compared to the placebo . taking the value of 8 . 4 as the base measurement for both the active group and the placebo group , the best possible ratio for improvement would be 0 . 6 with the scores dropping to the minimum number 5 . after ingesting either the active group or the placebo group , the active group participants showed a greater and faster recovery at 9 am ( 6 . 89 score and 0 . 788 ratio ) than the placebo group ( 7 . 67 score and 0 . 93 ratio ) with these scores taken from the average score of approximately 8 . 4 at 8 am . in addition , at 10 am the active group participants also showed a greater and faster recovery ( 6 . 32 score and 0 . 755 ratio ) than the placebo group ( 7 . 06 score and 0 . 859 ratio ). these scores were then analyzed using a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the improvement for the active group . with this study , a statistical analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of these values . a test result for the active group or the placebo group is statistically significant over the baseline if the p value is less than 0 . 05 ( p & lt ; 0 . 05 ). a repeated measures analysis of covariance ( baseline score and weight as covariates ) shows the improvement in the active group compared to the placebo group was significant ( p & lt ; 0 . 05 ). the symptoms of the users improved in both treatment groups in the second hour , as time became a factor in the alleviation of symptoms . the ratios after one hour post dosage were also significantly different ( p & lt ; 0 . 05 ) favoring the active treatment , based on an analysis of covariance . the second hour results favored the active treatment , but just missed statistical significance ( p & lt ; 0 . 08 ). in addition , looking at the individual scores , one hour after dosing , 9 of 19 ( 47 %) of the volunteers showed greater than 50 % improvement in the active group . in the placebo group 2 of 18 ( 11 %) of the volunteers showed a similar improvement ( p = 0 . 2 ), supporting the statistically significant difference in average results . more than 50 % improvement in symptom score is more than twice as probable with the active product than with the placebo . two hours after dosing , 13 of 19 ( 68 %) of the volunteers showed greater than 50 % improvement in the active group . in the placebo group only 7 of 18 volunteers ( 39 %) showed a similar improvement . thus , it seems apparent that the administration of this third embodiment of the invention helps to alleviate the side effects associated with the consumption of alcohol . accordingly , while several embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described , it is to be understood that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention ."}

ray tube 5 and the axis of rotation 4 . the rotating frame 2 is rotated about the axis 4 by a drive system 10 . another drive system 11 produces the linear scanning movement of the measuring arrangement 6 by means of a cable 12 . a box - shaped ( or cuboid ) compensating element 13 , of a strong plastics material equivalent to body tissue in its density , for example acrylic glass , is also fixedly connected to the rotating frame 2 . this compensating body 13 comprises , symmetrically to the axis of rotation 4 , a cylindrical recess into which a form - body in the shape of a ring 14 , which also consists of a strong plastics material equivalent to body tissue in its density , is slidingly inserted in a form locking manner . a contouring member 15 of an elastic material is attached to the inside of the ring 14 . this contouring member 15 can be filled with water by means of a pump ( not shown ) so that under selectable pressure it will fit firmly against the outside of the photographic subject , which may be the head of a patient , for example . the ring 14 is fixedly connected to a supporting table 17 by means of a bracket or plate 16 so that , despite the rotational movement of the compensating element 13 , no torque is applied to the photographic subject 3 resting on the supporting table 17 . the x -

ray beam 31 which is condensed by means of diaphragm 25 ; namely through its slit 28 . in the example , the x - ray beam has an approximately circular cross - section whose diameter is equal to the thickness of layer 30 . however , it is also possible within the framework of the invention to limit ( or define ) the x - ray beam in such a manner that its cross - sectional spread , perpendicular to layer 30 , is equal to the thickness of this layer , and that , parallel to layer 30 , it is less than the layer thickness . it will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts and teachings of the present invention ."}

[ 4 ]. output data for this degree of correspondence is dynamic angiography scenes , which show the diffusion or passage of the contrast agent through the corresponding vascular system . the virtual dynamic angiography s * ( the values indicated by * always relate in the following to the data derived from the virtual angiography ) is obtained by means of cfd simulation . the time intensity curves tic i , j and tic * i , j are now obtained from these two scenes s and s * for each pixel ( or combination of several pixels ). in the next step one or also more characteristic variables can be extracted from these time intensity curves , as described in \u201c parametric color coding of digital subtraction angiography \u201d by strother et al . [ 5 ]. these can be time values and / or intensity values or intensity values at defined times . fig2 shows by way of example a time intensity curve ( tic ) with drawn - in characteristic variables , in which the blood flow is plotted as intensity i over time t . after a noise - like behavior of the bolus curve 10 the intensity i climbs to the intensity maximum 11 ( i max ), in order then to drop back to a noise level . the bolus curve 10 is furthermore characterized by its half - width 12 ( fwhm \u2014 full width at half maximum ), which lies between the mean rise and the mean drop of the bolus curve . the arrival time 13 ( t rise ) is the time that elapses until the occurrence of the contrast agent bolus at the point under examination and thus until the rise in the bolus curve 10 . the mean rise time 14 ( t rise , fwhm ) is the time that elapses until the occurrence of the half - width 12 of the bolus curve 10 , i . e . until the bolus curve 10 has reached half of the intensity maximum 11 ( i max ). the time until the intensity maximum 11 ( i max ) is called the maximum time 15 ( t max ). the rise time 16 or wash - in time ( t wash in ) characterizes the steep rise in the bolus curve 10 . the drop in the bolus curve 10 is characterized by the drop time 17 or wash - out time ( t wash out ). the duration of the occurrence of the contrast agent bolus is characterized by the bolus or maximum time 18 ( t peak ). in the following let t i , j or t * i , j be the extracted variable for each pixel i , j from both angiographies . this produces a degree of correspondence b i , j of both angiographies from a mathematical link between both values t i , j or t * i , j , such as a simple subtraction for example . this degree of correspondence is thus a two - dimensional field , which can be represented for example as an image ( e . g . color - coded ) and permits an evaluation of the correspondence between the virtual and the real angiography . theoretically this degree of correspondence can be determined as in sun et al . [ 4 ] as a mean quadratic error for the entire curves tic i , j and tic * i , j . however , this means it is then subsequently not possible to say anything about the nature of the deviation and thus it cannot be used for purposeful control of the cfd optimization . until now , however , the two angiography scenes have not been synchronized . in this application there are various excellent vascular regions in the angiography images , among which are the vascular regions into which the blood or the contrast agent flows . in an improved embodiment regions of interest ( roi ) in these vascular regions can be defined in both images . in this case one or more roi , or corresponding roi * in the virtual image can be selected such that they cover the vascular inflow regions . in a next step the mean value of the characteristic variable t i , j , or t * i , j under consideration can be determined : mwt i , j , or mwt * i , j . from a comparison of these mean values a normalization is calculated in the following . this can be a difference ( in the case of temporal values ) or a factor e . g . in the case of intensity values , as well as other algorithms . thus the normalized degree of correspondence b i , j of both angiography recordings can be balanced : it is especially advantageous if the contrast inflow curve from the real angiography scene is used for the ( initial ) cfd simulation . if the simulation of the virtual angiography is performed such that the virtual inflow of the contrast agent matches reality , a normalization can be dispensed with however , it can also happen that both curves are delayed in respect of one another at the time of inflow or have different grayscale values . in this case , depending on the question , normalization will bring an improvement . essential for the invention are the definition of a degree of correspondence and the use thereof to assess and optimize the cfd simulation individual to the patient which until now has not been possible in - vivo . in particular the missing information on the local flow , into and out of the vascular segment under consideration , can herewith be adjusted iteratively to the real recorded 2d angiography recordings . this results in an improvement in the cfd results . this is based on the idea of comparing a virtual angiography obtained from the cfd simulation with the real angiography , determining a degree of correspondence , or if there is a difference optimizing the cfd so that the correspondence becomes better . in the case of a patient a 3d subtraction angiography with a c - arm system of the cerebral vessels and one ( or more ) 2d subtraction angiography scenes are recorded . in a first step a 3d surface model is generated in the computer following a segmentation of the relevant vascular section around an aneurysm , which is then used as geometry for the cfd simulation . moreover inflow and outflow regions are established . fig3 shows a vascular segment 20 with an afferent vessel 21 as an example for the definition of the region of interest roi and the associated basic conditions flow q and pressure p , which vessel branches into a first efferent vessel 22 and a second efferent vessel 23 . the vascular segment 20 furthermore has an aneurysm 24 . the inlet to the afferent vessel 21 is formed by an inflow region 25 . the outlet of the first efferent vessel 22 is formed by a first outflow region 26 and the outlet of the second efferent vessel 23 by a second outflow region 27 . a flow q in ( t ) and a pressure p in ( t ) prevail in the region of interest roi in of the inflow region 25 . in the region of interest roi out1 of the first outflow region 26 a flow q out1 ( t ) and a pressure p out1 ( t ) are measured and in the region of interest roi out2 of the second outflow region 27 a flow q out2 ( t ) and a pressure p out 2 ( t ) are measured . the selected volume is adjusted here to the 2d angiography , i . e . an angulation and projection geometry corresponding to the 2d angiography are determined in the 3d angiography . if both recordings originate from an examination which involves no movement of the patient this is simple to calculate , but otherwise a registration must be performed . thus the inflow region 25 and the outflow regions 26 and 27 are now also established in the 2d angiography . in the following cfd simulation the propagation of an injected contrast agent is simulated , among other things . the temporal dynamics of the contrast agent inflow can be adjusted to the averaged time intensity curve from the 2d angiography . after the simulation a virtual 2d angiography is calculated by means of known angulation and projection geometry using forward projection ( drr ), as is described for example in de 10 2007 039 034 a1 . in a next step the normalized degree of correspondence b \u2032 i , j e . g . for the bolus arrival times of both angiographies ( real and virtual ) is calculated . if for example the typical vascular segment 20 with the afferent vessel 21 , the aneurysm 24 and the two efferent vessels 22 and 23 is considered , a further evaluation for control of an iterative cfd simulation can now take place . to this end the normalized degree of correspondence averaged in the roi of the outflow regions 26 and 27 of the two efferent vessels 22 and 23 is considered . if it lies within a predefined tolerance , the result of the simulation is satisfactory in respect of these parameters , but otherwise this can be interpreted as a too fast or too slow flow in the entire vascular segment 20 . physically this means that the basic condition of pressure difference between inflow region 25 and outflow regions 26 and 27 was selected suboptimally . this can happen , since the vascular resistance distally to the vascular arborization section under consideration is generally not known . the tolerances can for example be predefined by a user . it is thereby determined how closely both angiographies , the virtual and the real angiography , must correspond before the user is satisfied . if the normalized degree of correspondence is positive , the calculated flow is too low and in the subsequent cfd simulation the pressure difference or the pressure conditions must be increased at the outflow regions 26 and 27 ( or variables corresponding thereto such as flow rate at the inflow region 25 ). in the case of a negative value the pressure difference can be reduced correspondingly . if the correspondence in both outflowing vascular segments roi out1 and roi out 2 is different , this can be corrected individually for each segment by the individual selection of the parameters . another example of this is concerned with the vascular walls . in cfd simulations the vascular walls are increasingly treated elastically . a corresponding analysis can orient the regions of interest along the vascular walls . these are segmented to this end . the degree of correspondence is now determined locally for all pixels along the vascular wall and if values are too large the elasticity for the subsequent cfd simulation is adjusted . it is especially advantageous here if real angiographies from several angulations are present . the inventive method is explained in greater detail on the basis of a flow chart shown in fig4 . first comes an acquisition 30 of a 3d angiography image dataset for model generation 31 . in the further method step a recording 32 of a contrast agent propagation is generated by means of dynamic real 2d angiography . then a cfd simulation 33 is performed , wherein it is possible to input 34 blood flow parameters as basic conditions . a virtual 2d angiography 35 from angulation identical to the real angiography 32 and adjusted recording geometry of the individual patient is calculated from this data . then follows a determination 36 of a degree of correspondence based on a comparison between the virtual angiography 35 and the real angiography 32 and then a check 37 to see whether the degree of correspondence is sufficient , i . e . whether the degree of correspondence is within a predefined tolerance . if the degree of correspondence is insufficient , a change 38 in the basic conditions in terms of an optimization is performed . then follows a new optimized cfd simulation 38 , by means of which again a determination 36 is performed , followed by a check 37 on the degree of correspondence . if in contrast the degree of correspondence is sufficient , the degree of correspondence is output 40 , for example as a color - coded image and the end of the examination is initiated . a ( percentage ) figure , if a global correspondence is considered , as well as a local figure can be described , which then itself can be output as a color map ( degree of correspondence ). however , it is also possible to describe other values ( for example the time difference for the maximum grayscale values ). fig5 shows the method sequence or workflow of the inventive method with the following steps in greater detail : s 1 ) 3d imaging for model generation , e . g . by means of 3d rotational angiography . s 2 ) recording a contrast agent propagation by means of dynamic 2d angiography . s 3 ) initial cfd simulation and generation of a virtual 2d angiography . s 4 ) determining a degree of correspondence between real and virtual 2d angiography . s 5 ) if degree of correspondence is sufficient , continue with s 9 ). s 6 ) changing one or more basic conditions of the cfd simulation according to the result of the degree of correspondence . s 7 ) renewed , optimized cfd simulation with basic conditions changed in terms of an optimization . s 8 ) back to s 4 ). s 9 ) done \u2014 optimum cfd simulation was achieved . the result is an iterative optimization of cfd simulation results based on the comparison between real and virtual 2 - dsa recordings on the basis of a determination of a

conjunction with a bone plate to provide the construct / fixation with added strength and stability compared to iliosacral fixation using screws alone .", "application_number": "US-201414562710-A", "description": "the instant invention is a novel method for posterior pelvic stabilization . the method uses internal hardware placed in a minimally invasive fashion . stabilization of pelvic ring injuries is most often indicated when the volume of the pelvis is increased and / or an unstable pattern of injury is present . this stabilization method must be applied in the operating room under sterile conditions with adequate fluoroscopic guidance . it can be utilized in an emergent setting following provisional stabilization in the emergency room with a pelvic binder , sheet or clamp . to aid in the determination of utilizing internal fixation methods , we prefer the tile classification since it is based on the concept of pelvic stability . in the tile classification , type a fractures involve a stable pelvic ring . the partially stable type b lesions , such as \u201c open - book \u201d and \u201c bucket - handle \u201d fractures , are caused by external and internal rotation forces , respectively . in type c injuries , there is complete disruption of the posterior sacroiliac complex . these unstable fractures are almost always caused by high - energy severe trauma associated with motor vehicle accidents , falls from a height , or crushing injuries . type a and type b fractures make up 70 % to 80 % of all pelvic injuries . internal fixation methods are typically considered for tile b and c type injuries . in many patients with partially stable injury patterns , the presence of significant pain with upright posture can be alleviated with the addition of internal fixation . if adequate reduction cannot be obtained in a closed manner , then more traditional open reduction techniques need to be employed . the patient may be positioned in the supine position on a radiolucent table . the skin may be prepped and draped from above the umbilicus to the proximal thigh . the lower extremity may be prepped into the field as well to facilitate reduction techniques . the posterior instability may be addressed first . the inventive procedure for placement of iliosacral screws and bone plate ( s ) for posterior pelvic instability will be described herein below , but first we need to describe the sacrum and sacroiliac joint in more detail . the sacroiliac joint is a diarthrodial joint that joins the sacrum to the ilium bones of the pelvis . in the sacroiliac joint , the sacral surface has hyaline cartilage that moves against fibrocartilage of the iliac surface . fig2 a depicts the medial aspect of a left ilium . the surface of the ilium and sacrum that form the sacroiliac joint is also known as the auricular surface 4 . the iliosacral screws of the present invention pass from the ilium into the sacrum through this auricular surface 4 . fig2 b depicts the anterior view of a sacrum . the auricular surface 4 is on either side of the sacrum 2 . among other things , the sacerum contains five vertebral bodies , s1 - 55 . the iliosacral screws pass through the ilium , through the auricular surface 4 , and into the s1 vertebral body for the upper screw and the s2 vertebral body for the lower screw . the method and apparatus for the minimally invasive treatment of unstable pelvic ring injuries with internal posterior iliosacral screw ( s ) and bone plate ( s ) will now be described with respect to the figures . fig3 a is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis having a pelvic ring fracture in which the left ilium 1 has separated from the sacrum 2 and right ilium 1 \u2032. fig3 b is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the first step of the inventive method has been performed . in the first step , the separated ilium 1 and the remainder of the pelvis are manipulated to bring the auricular surfaces of the separated ilium 1 and the sacrum 2 into alignment . then a cannulation guide wire 5 is inserted into the posterior of the ilium 1 adjacent to the s1 vertebral body and is then passed through the auricular surface and into the s1 vertebral body . the guide wire 5 should be advanced to near the medial area of the s1 vertebral body . fig3 b \u2032 depicts an anterior view of a horizontal cross section of the pelvis at the end of the first step , where the guide wire 5 has been advanced through the ilium 1 , through the auricular surface 4 ( also known as the sacroiliac joint 3 ), and into the sacrum . fig3 c is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the second step of the inventive method has been performed . in the second step , another cannulation guide wire 5 \u2032 is inserted into the posterior of the ilium 1 adjacent to the s2 vertebral body and is then passed through the sacroiliac joint , into and through the s2 vertebral body and into the opposite ilium 1 \u2032. the second guide wire 5 \u2032 should be advanced through the s2 vertebral body , and if a second plate is to be placed on the opposite ilium 1 \u2032, the guide wire should be advanced completely through the opposite auricular surface and through the opposite ilium 1 \u2032. it should be noted that the order of the first and second steps is interchangeable . in practice , in some instances , there may be some advantage to the order in which the cannulation guide wires 5 , 5 \u2032 are inserted . fig3 d is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the third step of the inventive method has been performed . in the third step a two holed bone plate 6 is slid over the guide wires 5 , 5 \u2032 and advanced to the surface of the ilium 1 . fig3 d \u2032 depicts an anterior view of a horizontal cross section of the pelvis at the end of the third step of the inventive method , where the bone plate 6 has been slid over guide wires 5 , 5 \u2032 and advanced to the surface of the ilium 1 . fig3 e is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the fourth step of the inventive method has been performed . in the fourth step a cannulated screw 7 ( either cancellous or cortical and either fully or partially threaded ) is inserted onto the superior cannulation guide wire 5 , and screwed through the superior opening in the bone plate 6 , through the ilium 1 , the auricular surface and into the s1 vertebral body . preferably , the cannulated screw 7 is long enough to extend from the bone plate 6 , to a medial location within the s1 vertebral body . fig3 e \u2032 depicts an anterior view of a horizontal cross section of the pelvis at the end of the fourth step of the inventive method , where the cannulated screw 7 has been screwed through the bone plate 6 and into the s1 vertebral body . fig3 f is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the fifth step of the inventive method has been performed . in the fifth step another cannulated screw 8 is inserted onto the inferior cannulation guide wire 5 \u2032, and screwed through the inferior opening in the bone plate 6 , through the ilium 1 , the auricular surface and the s2 vertebral body . preferably , the cannulated screw 8 is long enough to extend from the bone plate 6 to a position all of the way through the s2 vertebral body and into the opposite ilium 1 \u2032. again , if a second plate is to be placed on the opposite ilium 1 \u2032, the cannulated screw 8 should be advanced completely through the opposite ilium 1 \u2032 and protrude far enough that it may be affixed to the second plate . it should be noted that the order of the fourth and fifth steps is interchangeable . in practice , in some instances , there may be some advantage to the order in which the cannulated screws 7 , 8 are inserted . fig3 g is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein the sixth step of the inventive method has been performed . in the sixth step , the cannulation guide wires 5 , 5 \u2032 are removed leaving the cannulated iliosacral screws 7 , 8 and the bone plate 6 in place to fixate the unstable pelvic ring fracture . fig3 g \u2032 depicts an anterior view of a horizontal cross section of the pelvis at the end of the sixth step of the inventive method , where the cannulation guide wires 5 , 5 \u2032 have been removed leaving the iliosacral screws 7 , 8 and the bone plate 6 in place . fig3 h is a depiction of the posterior of a pelvis , wherein optional additional steps have been performed to create a bilateral fixation by adding an additional iliosacral screw 7 \u2032 and bone plate 6 \u2032 to the opposite iliosacral joint of the pelvis . that is , a cannulation guide wire is inserted through the other ilium 1 \u2032, the other auricular surface and into the s1 vertebral body . another bone plate 6 \u2032 is placed over the cannulation guide wire and then an additional cannulated screw 7 \u2032 is placed onto the additional cannulation guide wire , and screwed through the superior opening in the bone plate 6 \u2032, through the ilium 1 \u2032, the auricular surface and into the s1 vertebral body . preferably , the cannulated screw 7 \u2032 is long enough to extend from the bone plate 6 \u2032, to a medial location within into the s1 vertebral body . the inferior opening in the bone plate 6 \u2032 is affixed to the end of the cannulated screw 8 that protrudes from the opposite ilium 1 \u2032. this may be accomplished by either : 1 ) threading the protruding end of the cannulated screw 8 into the threads of the second bone plate 6 \u2032; or , 2 ) by passing the protruding end of the cannulated screw 8 through the inferior opening in the bone plate 6 \u2032 and threading a nut ( not shown ) onto the protruding end the cannulated screw 8 and tightening the nut against the bone plate 6 \u2032. fig3 h \u2032 depicts an anterior view of a horizontal cross section of the pelvis at the end of the optional additional steps of the inventive method . as described above an additional cannulated screw 7 \u2032 is inserted through the superior opening in an additional bone plate 6 \u2032, through the opposite ilium 1 \u2032, the opposite auricular surface 4 \u2032, and into the s1 vertebral body . fig4 a depicts a cross section of a cannulated screw 7 and specifically shows how a cannulated screw 7 may be inserted onto the cannulation guide wire 5 . fig4 b show a cannulated screw 7 inserted onto a cannulation guide wire 5 . also shown in both figures is the locking head 9 of the screw , because the preferred embodiment is used in a variable - angle locked plating system . fig5 is a depiction of a lateral view of a pelvis ( ilium 1 , sacrum 2 ) having been fixated using the inventive method and apparatus . the cannulated screws 7 , 8 pass through the auricular surface 4 , holding ilium 1 and sacrum 2 together . the bone plate 6 gives the fixation construct additional strength by resisting the possibility of pulling the cannulated screws 7 , 8 through the ilium 1 , 1 \u2032 when the pelvis is weight bearing . further , one can see the cannulation openings 7 \u2033, 8 \u2033 in the cannulated screws 7 , 8 . fig6 a and 6b are depictions of different views of a type bone plating system , a variable - angle locked plating system , useful in the present invention . while other bone plating systems may be used , the variable - angle locked plating system is preferred in that this type of system allows for conformity of the bone plate 6 , 6 \u2032 with the ilium 1 , 1 \u2032, while allowing the cannulated screws 7 , 7 \u2032, and 8 to be inserted into the ilium / sacrum at the needed proper angle . the screws and plates of the present invention are formed from sturdy bio - compatible materials , preferably titanium . the screws may be between 7 . 0 - 8 . 5 mm in outer diameter ( o . d . ), inclusive , and the cannulation guide wires may be 3 mm o . d . after stabilizing the posterior elements via the iliosacral screws and bone plate ( s ) method / construct of the present invention , the anterior pelvis may be addressed . preferably the anterior fixation methods / apparatuses are those disclosed in u . s . pat . nos . 8 , 900 , 278 ; 8 , 814 , 866 ; 8 , 398 , 635 ; and 8 , 177 , 785 , the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference . it is to be expected that considerable variations may be made in the embodiments disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention . accordingly , the significant improvements offered by this invention are to be limited only by the scope of the following claims ."}

s pharmaceutical sciences , mack publishing co ., easton , pa . the preferred flavonoid compounds for inhibiting the release of il - 6 from mast cell vesicles are quercetin , myrisetin , genistein and kaempferol ; quercetin is highly preferred . in order to increase absorption , these flavonoids may be administered as their glycoside derivatives . these compounds may be obtained from kaden biochemicals , hillsborough , n . j . the preferred concentration range of the flavonoid components of oral formulations are 10 - 3 , 000 mg per tablet or capsule . the number of capsules or tablets to be taken per day is determined by the nature and severity of the medical condition , and is readily determinable by the patient &# 39 ; s physician . other representative formulations are described in the examples below . human cord blood - derived mast cells ( hcbmc ) were grown from cd34 + progenitor mononuclear umbilical cells isolated from umbilical cord blood by positive selection of ac133 ( cd 133 +/ cd34 + high ) cells by magnetic cell sorting ( miltenyi biotec , auburn , calif .). cd34 + cells were then cultured in isocove &# 39 ; s modified dulbecco &# 39 ; s medium ( 1mdm ) containing 100 ng / ml stem cell factor ( from amgen , thousand oaks , calif .) plus test components in 10 % fbs at 37 \u00b0 c . in 5 % co 2 balanced air . by 10 weeks , 95 % of the cells in culture could be identified as mast cells by immuno - staining for tryptase . hcbmc were washed three times in pbs and resuspended in culture medium ( 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells / 200 ul sample ). test substances , e . g ., il - 1 were added and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0 c . in 5 % co 2 for six hours for dose - response experiments or for the indicated times in time - course experiments . il - 6 and tryptase were measured in cell - free supernatant fluids by elisa ( r & amp ;

the three lower concentration of the flavonoid only slightly reduced the secretion of the cytokine compared to ige alone . the two concentrations of the flavonoid morin had only a small effect on il - 6 secretion in the presence of anti - ige ; so did a high concentration of cromolyn , but this effect was not statistically significant . these results demonstrate the specificity of the flavonoid effect that is quercetin , but not morin , inhibited the anti - ige - mediated increase in the secretion of il - 6 from human mast cells . in this experiment , the selective secretion of il - 6 from hcbmc in the absence and presence of crh , il - 1 or anti - ige antibody was studied . in parallel incubations , the effect of each of these agents on the secretion of tryptase from mast cell granules was also examined . the results are shown in table 3 . low concentrations of crh , il - 1 and anti - ige antibody profoundly increased the production and secretion of il - 6 . neither crh nor il - 1 increased the secretion of the marker tryptase , suggesting that neither of these agents stimulated degranulation of the cells . in contrast , anti - ige antibody greatly increased the secretion of this marker protein . in this experiment , the effects of quercetin , alone or together with il - 1 , on the production and secretion of il - 6 from human mast cells was studied . the results are shown in table 4 . the results indicate that neither quercetin alone northe solvent ( dmso ) in which it was dissolved had a significant effect on il - 6 secretion , even though the highest concentration slightly decreased the spontaneous formation of il - 6 . il - 1 alone caused a great increase in il - 6 . this effect of il - 1 on il - 6 was greatly inhibited by quercetin in a dose - dependent fashion . it is known ( marshall et al . j . clin . invest . 97 : 1122 ( 1996 )) that interleukin - 10 ( il - 10 ) can inhibit il - 6 production from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) and anti - ige antibody , even though il - 10 did not influence histamine release . no one has examined this phenomenon in human mast cells . the effect of il - 10 on hmc - 1 leukemic cells producing il - 6 , especially cells stimulated by il - 1 that induces selective release of il - 6 , was studied alone or together with a flavonoid compound . the results are shown in table 5 . the results of these experiments indicate that a combination of low doses of il - 10 and quercetin had a synergistic inhibitory effect on il - 6 secretion from hmc - 1 cells . this combination may , therefore , be effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases presenting with high il - 6 , especially systemic mastocytosis . certain histamine - i receptor antagonists have been shown to inhibit cytokine secretion from human leukemic mast cells ( lippert et al , exp . dermatol . 2 : 118 ( 2000 ). azelastine , like olopatadine , is a histamine - 1 receptor antagonist , and has been reported to inhibit tryptase secretion ( lytinas et al ., allergy asthma proc . 23 : ( 2002 )). here we show ( fig4 ) that azelastine is a potent inhibitor of il - 6 secretion from hcbmc ; this inhibition was dose - dependent and , at 60 \u03bcm , this compound reduced il - 6 secretion to below control levels . azelastine . hcl may be obtained from wallace laboratories , cranbury , n . j . it may also be obtained from the same company as astelin , a nasal spray containing 0 . 1 % azelastine . hcl in aqueous solution . in vivo , azelastine may be administered at a dosage of about 2 to 100 mg per 70 kg body weight per day . at concentrations below 1 \u03bcm azelastine was ineffective ; however , when added together with 10 \u03bcm quercetin , the combination inhibited il - 6 secretion from hcbmc ( table 6 ). these results , taken together , demonstrate that certain flavonoid compounds inhibit the production and secretion of il - 6 from human mast cells that are stimulated by different inflammatory stimuli ."}

containing sauce for primary aging . the salt - containing sauce is a marinade containing refined salt , soy sauce , pepper powder , white sugar , and onion juice as main components . the aging time may be in a range of 24 \u02dc 48 hours . the spices soak into the raw meat through the aging process . next , the surface of each of the raw meat pieces is coated with coating powder . when it is necessary to relieve the salty taste of the meat , the salt - containing sauce can be removed from the surface of the raw meat pieces before it is coated with coating powder . the coating powder is prepared by adding seasonings , such as refined salt , monosodium l - glutamate , red pepper powder , black pepper powder , garlic powder , etc ., into wheat flour or corn starch , which are main components . an appropriate mixing ratio of seasonings in the coating powder is shown in table 1 . an optimal mixing ratio of seasonings in coating powder determined through several times of test cooking is shown in table 2 . a hot seasoning may be further added to emphasize the hot taste . next , the raw meat pieces coated with the coating powder is subjected to secondary aging for a predetermined time to allow the coating powder on the surface of the raw meat to absorb moisture in the raw meat and form a coating powder layer . in this secondary aging process , the raw meat pieces on which the coating powder has been coated are maintained in a dark refrigeration space at a temperature of \u2212 2 . 0 \u02dc 10 . 0 \u00b0 c . for 1 \u02dc 2 hours . alternatively , if necessary to cook quickly , instead of waiting for the coating powder layer to be formed by absorbing moisture in the raw meat , the coating power layer can be formed by spraying water on the coating power of the surface of the raw meat . however , for more crispy taste of the surface of the meat prepared according to present invention , it is better to wait for the coating powder layer to be formed by absorbing moisture in the raw meat through the secondary aging process . next , the secondarily aged raw meat pieces are roasted in an oven in a closed state at a temperature of 130 \u02dc 270 \u00b0 c . for 7 \u02dc 20 minutes . any type of cooking device , such as a gas oven , an electric oven , etc ., can be used provided that it has a closed space for heating . however , cooking devices using radiation heat or convection heat are preferred to cooking devices using heat conduction , like frying fans . in the cooking method according to the present invention , cooking devices using radiation heat or convection heat are suitable to uniformly heat the aged raw meat pieces of a predetermined size . next , the raw meat pieces are further roasted at a temperature of 130 \u02dc 270 \u00b0 c . for 2 \u02dc 5 minutes while supplying an air flow to the oven . in this process , air is flowed into the oven to evaporate moisture from the surface of the coating powder layer of the meat and exhaust the moisture out of the oven . this process facilitates the evaporation of moisture from the surface of the meat . if air is flowed throughout the entire roasting operation , i . e ., from the beginning to the end of the roasting operation , or if the duration of roasting the meat while supplying an air flow is longer than 5 minutes , too much moisture in the meat is evaporated and the meat texture becomes too tough or chewy . if the duration of roasting the meat while supplying an air flow is shorter than 2 minutes , a proper amount of moisture cannot be evaporated from the coating powder layer and the roasted meat is not crispy . the roasting time ranging from 2 \u02dc 5 minutes can be varied according to the water content of the raw meat . the surface of the meat roasted through the above - described processes looks very similar to common fried chicken . in addition , the surface of the roasted meat is crispy while the inner flesh is tender and moist . although the surface of the meat cooked according to the present invention looks very similar to common fried chicken , the meat cooked according to the present invention has very different composition from the common fried chicken . in particular , since the coating powder layer on the meat is fried by oil contained in the meat through two roasting processes , its fat and cholesterol contents are markedly lower than those of common fried chicken , which is fried in cooking oil . in addition , since the oil in the meat comes out , the inner flesh becomes non - greasy , soft , and less tough . in conventional methods of cooking by frying , due to the repeated use of frying oil and the oxidization of the oil , cholesterol content increases . in addition , it is highly likely that foreign substance is incorporated into the oil during storage , and small fragments of previously fried foods remain , raising a hygienic problem . however , in the cooking method according to the present invention , such problems do not arise , and low fat , cholesterol , and calory food can be hygienically cooked . the two roasting processes in the cooking method according to the present invention may be performed in reverse order . in other words , the roasting process performed while supplying an air flow can be performed first . however , to accelerate the evaporation of moisture to obtain cooked meat with a crispy surface coating , it is preferable to perform the roasting process while supplying an air flow secondly . any kind of raw meat can be cooked using the above - described cooking method according to the present invention . examples of raw meat that can be cooked according to the present invention include : meats , such as pork , beef , etc . ; fowls , such as chicken , duck , goose , turkey , etc . ; seafoods , such as lobster , shrimp , shellfish , fishes , etc . for a high fat content raw meat , such as pork , bread crumbles may be added to the coating powder such that a larger amount of the oily component in the raw meat can be absorbed . as a result , a less greasy , tender , and moist cooked meat with a crispy coating can be obtained . as described above , in a cooking method according to the present invention , instead of frying a raw meat in boil , after coating the raw meat with a coating powder layer , the raw meat is roasted using oil contained in the raw meat while supplying an air flow for a predetermined duration to evaporate moisture in the meat and increase crispiness of the surface of the meat . the obtained cooked meat has low fat content and is not greasy . in addition , the surface coating of the cooked meat is crispy while the inner flesh thereof is tender and moist . in a nutritional aspect , using the cooking method according to the present invention , which does not involve frying in oil , low calory , fat , and cholesterol foods can be cooked , which complies with the currently spread healthy diet trend . in particular , when the cooking method according to the present invention is used to cook chicken , low calory , fat , and cholesterol , healthy cooked chicken , which is very similar to popular fried chicken , can be obtained . according to the present invention , a plate of chicken that has low trans fatty acid content and is good for health can be prepared . trans fatty acids in diet , which are generated as a result of partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils , have been implicated to cause or exacerbate most modern diseases , including heart disease , cancer , diabetes , obesity , immune dysfunction , and bone loss . the major form of trans fatty acid included in milk , dairy products , meat etc . is vaccenic acid ( trans - 11 , 18 : 1 ). table 3 shows the contents of vaccenic acid ( trans - 11 , 18 : 1 ) in the skin of chicken prepared to be served to a customer . the content of vaccenic acid ( trans - 11 , 18 : 1 ) in the skin of the plate of chicken prepared according to the method of present invention was about 4 . 25 %. however , in the case of comparative example 1 ( fried chicken cooked by frying in oil , company a ), the content of vaccenic acid ( trans - 11 , 18 : 1 ) was about 12 . 94 %. in the case of comparative example 2 ( fried chicken cooked by frying in oil , company b ), the content of vaccenic acid ( trans - 11 , 18 : 1 ) was about 6 . 12 %. a cooking method according to another embodiment of the present invention is the same , from cutting raw meat into pieces to aging the raw meat pieces with a salt - containing sauce , as the embodiment described above . when the aging process is completed , primary roasting is performed . in primary roasting , the raw meat pieces are cooked to an extent of about 30 % to about 70 % using steam or oven heat . for example , the raw meat pieces may be primarily roasted using a far - infrared radiation oven . when a far - infrared radiation oven is used , the temperature of a far - infrared bulb may be maintained at about 300 \u00b0 c . to about 550 \u00b0 c . in this case , the surface temperature of the raw meat pieces is maintained at about 30 \u00b0 c . to about 80 \u00b0 c . for about 10 to about 20 minutes . the primary roasting process sterilizes the raw meat pieces to some extent and removes oil from the raw meat pieces . in addition , water contained in surface regions of the raw meat pieces is partially evaporated . in the primary roasting operation , the water content of the raw meat pieces may be reduced to about 10 . 0 wt % to about 15 . 0 wt %. if the water content is less than 10 . 0 wt %, crispness of the surface of a coating powder layer of cooked meat may be reduced . on the other hand , if the water content is more than 15 . 0 wt %, the cooked meat may become tough . next , a coating powder layer is formed . the oil removed from surface regions of the raw meat pieces in the primary roasting operation enables coating powder to easily adhere the surface of the raw meat pieces , and thus forms the coating powder layer . examples of the coating powder are the same as described in the previous embodiment . in addition , the composition of the coating powder is not limited to the compositions suggested in tables 1 and 2 above . for example , wheat flour or corn starch may be partially or wholly substituted with one component selected from the group consisting of rice flour , barley flour , soybean flour , potato starch and sweet potato starch . next , secondary roasting is performed to finish cooking the raw meat pieces . the secondary roasting operation includes preheating a roasting utensil and placing and heating the raw meat pieces in the preheated roasting utensil . in the secondary roasting operation , the heating temperature may be in a range of about 130 \u00b0 c . to about 270 \u00b0 c ., and the heating time may be in a range of about 9 to about 25 minutes . the roasting utensil may include any type of cooking device for roasting in a closed environment , such as a gas oven , an electric oven , etc . for example , the roasting utensil may include heating wires in upper and lower racks where the raw meat pieces are to be placed so that the top and bottom surfaces of the raw meat pieces can be heated . in the secondary roasting operation , air may be made flow into the roasting utensil for about 2 to about 5 minutes . air flowing into the oven exhausts water vapor out of the roasting utensil , and thus facilitates the evaporation of water from the surfaces of the raw meat pieces . if air is made to flow throughout the entire roasting operation , i . e ., from the beginning to the end of the roasting operation , or if the duration of roasting the raw meat pieces while supplying an air flow is longer than 5 minutes , too much moisture in the raw meat pieces is evaporated and the meat texture becomes too tough or chewy . if the duration of roasting the raw meat pieces while supplying an air flow is shorter than 2 minutes , a proper amount of moisture cannot be evaporated from the coating powder layer and the roasted meat is not crispy . the roasting time ranging from about 2 to about 5 minutes may be varied according to the water content of the raw meat . the surface of the meat roasted by performing the above - described processes looks very similar to common fried chicken . in addition , the surface of the roasted meat is crispy while the inner flesh is tender , non - greasy and moist . although the surface of the meat cooked according to the present invention looks very similar to common fried chicken , the meat cooked according to the present invention has a very different composition from common fried chicken . in particular , since the coating powder layer on the meat is fried by oil contained in the meat through two roasting processes , its fat and cholesterol contents are markedly lower than those of common fried chicken , which is fried in cooking oil . in addition , since the oil in the meat is removed , the inner flesh becomes non - greasy , soft , and less tough . in conventional methods of cooking by frying , due to the repeated use of frying oil , it is highly likely that foreign substances are incorporated into the oil during storage , and small fragments of previously fried foods remain , raising a hygienic problem . however , in the cooking method according to the present invention , such problems do not arise , and low fat , and low calorie food can be hygienically cooked . while the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to embodiments thereof , the embodiments are for only descriptive purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention . the scope of the invention is defined only by the appended claims . it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims ."}

surface 62 is shown as a continuous surface , it could also have one or more holes . the top surface 62 is connected to the hinge 18 by a rear flange 64 . the rear flange 64 is angled upwardly as it extends from the hinge 18 to the top part 62 . the top part 16 also has an upwardly angled left flange 66 and an upwardly angled right flange 68 , as well as a left side strip 72 and a right side strip 74 . the left flange 66 and right flange 68 angle upwardly as they extend from the respective left strip 72 and the right strip 74 to the top surface 62 . the left strip 72 and right strip 74 are also substantially coplanar . a tab 76 is formed at the forward edge of the top surface 62 . the tab 76 is connected to the top surface 62 by a frangible connection , for example a line of perforations 78 . other types of frangible connections could be employed to secure the tab 76 to the top surface 62 . the flexible sheet 82 of the container 12 is shown disassembled from the container in fig7 . the sheet 82 can be constructed of any known material typically employed in hermetically sealing packages such as plastic , foil , etc . the sheet 82 has an elongate length with a pair of parallel left 84 and right 86 side edges that extend along a majority of the sheet length to an end edge 88 of the sheet . the end edge 88 is substantially perpendicular to the side edges 84 , 86 . the width of the sheet between the side edges 84 , 86 is substantially the same as the width of the flat border surface 42 of the container bottom part 14 . a pair of inwardly angled edges 92 , 94 extend forwardly from the respective left 84 and right 86 side edges of the sheet . the angled edges 92 , 94 extend forwardly to a tab 96 formed on the sheet 82 . the tab 96 has substantially the same configuration as the tab 76 on the container top part 16 . in an alternate embodiment the tab 96 could just be an extension of the sheet and not have the configuration shown . when the sheet is assembled into the container 12 it is folded over at a fold 98 . the folded sheet has a lower piece 102 and an upper piece 104 . after the ant bait or other substance 106 has been positioned in the receptacle 22 , the sheet 82 is assembled to the container 12 as shown in fig8 . the end edge 88 of the sheet is positioned adjacent the forward end of the border surface 42 of the container bottom part 14 . in an alternate embodiment the sheet end edge 88 could be positioned adjacent the forward edge 58 of the inclined surface 56 . the lower piece 102 of the sheet is laid across the border surface 42 and over the receptacle 22 . the portion of the sheet lower piece 102 that engages with the border surface 42 is removably secured to the border surface by adhesives , by heat sealing , by

container top piece 16 . this portion of the sheet is not secured to the top surface 62 or any other portion of the container top piece 16 . however , the tab 96 of the sheet is secured by adhesives , heat sealing , rf welding or other equivalent means to the container top piece tab 76 . with the sheet 82 assembled to the container bottom part 14 and top part 16 as shown in fig8 , the container top part 16 is folded over the bottom part 14 to complete the assembly of the container 12 as shown in fig1 - 5 . the angled flanges of the bottom part 44 , 46 , 48 and the angled flanges of the top part 64 , 66 , 68 space the top part tab 76 above the inclined surface 56 and form an opening 108 into the container interior . the side strips 52 , 54 of the container bottom part 14 and the respective

remainder of the container . when the top part tab 76 separates from the top surface 62 , continued pulling of the container tab 76 and the connected tab 94 of the sheet will pull the sheet through the container opening 108 . continued pulling will gradually cause the sheet lower piece 102 to peel away from the border surface 42 of the container bottom part 14 . continued pulling will remove the sheet 82 from the interior of the container 14 and expose the ant bait 106 in the receptacle 22 to the exterior environment of the container through the container opening 108 . still further pulling will separate the sheet 82 from the container 12 . the container 12 is then ready for use as an ant trap . when placed on a floor surface , the inclined surface 56 provides access to the opening 108 and the ant bait in the container interior . although the container 12 is described above is being used as an ant trap containing an ant bait , it should be appreciated that the container can be used to contain any substance , for example other types of insect baits , or air fresheners , or animal repellents , or other types of substances . additionally , although the container 12 is described as having only one receptacle 22 , it should be appreciated that the container could be formed with multiple receptacles positioned side - by - side along the flat border surface 42 of the container bottom part 14 . pulling the sheet 82 from the container could be stopped after one of the receptacles 22 is uncovered , exposing the substance of the one receptacle to the exterior environment of the container through the opening 108 . once the substance in the one receptacle is no longer useful , the sheet 82 could then be further pulled from the container to expose the second receptacle to the exterior environment . still further , although the container 12 has been described with the bottom part 14 and top part 16 being connected by a hinge 18 , the container could be constructed with the bottom part 14 and top part 16 being separate parts . as various modifications could be made in the construction of the invention herein described and illustrated without departing from the scope of

absorptive , and / or overwrap components of the tampon . antimicrobial agents are agents which inhibit growth or kill bacteria . controlling the localization of these antimicrobial agents is important . if the localization of the antimicrobial agents is not controlled , disruption and / or depletion of the indigenous microflora covering the vaginal mucosa would potentially be harmful to the overall health of the vaginal canal . the antimicrobial activities of many antimicrobial agents are dependent upon solubilization and uptake by the microorganisms of interest . the antimicrobial agents may be covalently linked to the non - absorbent material of the tampon , either directly or through modification . the presence and detection of the antimicrobial agents by the vaginal microorganisms would be sufficient to delay or decrease the potential overall colonization of the tampon during typical wear . modification of the antimicrobial agent to allow the antimicrobial to be immobilized , for example via \u2014 ch 2 \u2014 or \u2014 ch 2 \u2014 ch 2 \u2014 etc . linker , while not obstructing their active sites would allow for increased availability and effectiveness against colonization of the tampon . however , linking the anitmicrobial agents to the absorbent component of the tampon may decrease the tampon &# 39 ; s overall effectiveness . antimicrobial agents that can be utilized for this purpose may include but are not limited to clindamycin , lysostaphin , phmb , triclosan , and quaternary ammonia compounds . clindamycin and lysostaphin are discussed in more detail below . an additional benefit of using clindamycin is that this agent depresses toxin production by s . aureus . clindamycin hydrochloride , or cleocin \u00ae hcl , is currently used to treat vaginal infections . it is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by 7 ( s )- chloro - substitution of the 7 ( r )- hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin . clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome . it binds preferentially to the 50s ribosomal subunit and affects the process of peptide chain initiation . although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro , rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active form . clindamycin has been shown to be an effective antimicrobial agent for a number of organisms reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis , such as bacteroides spp ., prevotella spp ., gardnerella vaginalis , mycoplasma hominis and peptostreptococcus spp . the antimicrobial agent lysostaphin ( a zinc dependent , 25 - kda glycyl - glycine endopeptidase isolated from s . simulans ) is a specific peptidoglycan hydrolase (\u201c pgh \u201d) enzyme for staphylococcus bacteria . pgh enzymes are incorporated and coordinated with the use of absorbent articles to reduce the risk of colonization of the absorbent article by staphylococcus . pgh enzymes are naturally present in small amounts in bacteria where they are essential for cell wall re - modeling that must occur with cell growth and division . because bacterial peptidoglycan structures differ significantly , pghs can be found to target specific bacterial species or groups of related organisms . specifically , the action of lysostaphin is hydrolysis of the \u2014 gly + gly \u2014 bond in the pentaglycine inter - peptide link joining staphylococcal cell wall peptidoglycans , thereby , digesting the peptidoglycan \u201c structural barrier \u201d of the bacterial cell walls . added in excess they rapidly digest peptidoglycan resulting in cell rupture . therefore , lysostaphin , which is a specific pgh enzyme to staphylococcal organisms , would prevent s . aureus and other staphylococcal organisms from colonizing the tampon without adversely affecting the non - staphylococcal dominate species of the vaginal canal . lysostaphin &# 39 ; s n - terminal of the enzymatic protein is the enzymatically active region and the c - terminal is what confers target cell specificity and allows it to distinguish between s . aureus and its parent cells s . simulans ( baba & amp ; schneewind , embo j . 1996 ). crosslinking the protein to a matrix via its c - terminal region would anchor the protein and still allow it to some degree to be enzymatically active against staphylococcal spp . antibiofilm formation agents may be incorporated into an absorbent product such as a tampon to prevent the colonization of the absorbent product . antifouling agents are an antibiofilm formation agent which may also be incorporated into the tampon &# 39 ; s construction . the antifouling agents can be incorporated into the tampon &# 39 ; s construction by binding . the binding of the antifouling agents is important because of the non impact or influence upon an environment external to its current environment . for example , an anti - microbial agent located in the tampon should not impact or influence the growth of bacteria outside the tampon . the two types of antifouling agents which may be incorporated are furanones and l - acyl homoserine lactones . furanones are halogenated compounds that are known to depress gram - negative bacterial growth and kill gram - positive bacteria . l - acyl homoserine lactones are specific to gram - negative bacteria and are also known to control virulence factors . these agents need to be immobilized to the components of the tampon and prohibited from coming into direct contact with the microflora of the vaginal canal . furthermore , quorum sensing signals are active biofilm forming signals for gram - positive organisms and may be employed to inhibit colonization of a tampon . quorum signals will be discussed in depth in section c of the phase ii discussions . biostatic agents decrease bacterial growth . biostatic agents such as the common histochemical dyes , methylene blue , and gentian violet can be cross - linked to cellulose fibers and other potential absorptive materials . methylene blue is a redox dye that raises the oxygen consumption of cells . this means that the protons ( hydrogens ) of the materials to be oxidized are passed on to the oxygen molecules present in the environment . methylene blue in an unbound state acts as an electron carrier short circuiting the electron transport process which is responsible for atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) production within the cell ( as shown in fig1 ). a similar mechanism is hypothesized when methlene blue is bound to a fiber structure . coating the absorbent article and its components with negatively charged molecules prevents the colonization of the absorbent product / tampon . negatively charged tampon and / or its components electrostatically repel bacterial cell surfaces which are negatively charged . if the materials of the absorbent product were negatively charged via the use of po 4 or so 4 etc ., bacteria would be repelled from forming biofilm and or rapidly dividing in this negatively charged environment . incorporating the encapsulation of enzymes and or active agents with an absorptive product such as a tampon prevents the colonization of s . aureus . antimicrobial and / or biostatic agents can be encapsulated by the use of hydrophilic isocyanate polymers . these polymers are water - soluble and a variety of molecules can be incorporated into these hydrophilic urethane type polymers . during the polymerization of hydrophilic isocyanate prepolymers , carbon dioxide is typically generated keeping the oxygen levels in the immediate environment low . this low oxygen environment aides in the overall stability of any enzyme added to the prepolymer emulsion which becomes an integral part of the resultant copolymer . the enzyme ( s ) or other chemical antimicrobial / biostatic agent ( s ) participates in the polymerization and is typically chemically attached at multiple points within the resulting isocyanate copolymer matrix essentially becoming caged within the isocyanate polymer . as described previously , the overall availability and effectiveness of the caged enzyme may be increased by first modifying the attachment site of the enzyme to the polymer matrix via the addition of a \u201c linker \u201d molecule . within this copolymer matrix a variety of enzymes have been shown to be thermally stable over time . since this is an aqueous polymerization event , upon hydration of the copolymer matrix the enzyme or microbial agent becomes \u201c active \u201d and can exhibit a retention of specific activity as high as 80 % of \u201c uncaged \u201d activity . this solubilization of the isocyante polymer allows for a controlled release of the enzyme as fluid triggers the solubilization of the urethane like gel . the components , which exhibit antimicrobial or biostatic activity , are covalently bound to the polymer . upon hydration , the polymer is eroded to release the active material at the preferred site of action . it is preferred to keep antimicrobial and biostatic agents isolated from the vaginal mucosa . this may be accomplished by the use of appropriate overwraps that cover the absorbent core . for example , formed film overwraps may be used or nonwoven overwraps made of rayon , cotton , polyesters , polyolefins that provide separation where the core is isolated from the surrounding vaginal tissue preventing destruction and / or alteration to the vaginal flora . the overwrap may also act in combination with the absorbent core to provide a one - way valve such that fluid enters the tampon and is irreversibly trapped . this tampon exhibits the one - way property when it is loaded with saline at 75 % of syngyna capacity , allowed to equilibrate for fifteen minutes and then placed on blotter paper , the tampon is then rolled over the blotter paper without pressure applied to remove free fluid on the surface of the tampon . the tampon is then placed on a fresh blotter paper and compressed with a force of 1 psi . if the squeeze out on the blotter paper is less than 0 . 1 grams the tampon is considered to be a one - way valve . physical separation of the inhibitor or antimicrobial agent can be demonstrated by adding sterile saline solution ( at syngyna capacity ) gently blot the surface to remove free fluid and place the tampon containing the inhibitor onto an agar place colonized with a lawn of lactobacillas . if the lactobacillas lawn is not disturbed / killed at the contact point between the tampon and the agar plate physical separation is demonstrated . extensive in vitro work describes the environmental and genetic conditions required for s . aureus to produce tsst - 1 toxin . current in vivo physiological understanding of the dynamics of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide in the tampon during menstrual wear indicate that optimum conditions for toxin production by s . aureus must exist within the tampon . the oxygen required for potential toxin production within the tampon is believed to come from the inherent air within the tampon and the oxygen carried by the menstrual fluid absorbed by the tampon . the inherent oxygen of the tampon is essentially unutilized by the facultative microorganisms of the vaginal canal in the absence of blood / menses . however , in the presence of a heavy loading of blood / menses virtually all of the oxygen in the tampon can be consumed , while the dissolved carbon dioxide levels within the tampon rise significantly above that present in the vaginal environment . as shown in fig2 a , during non - menstrual wear , carbon dioxide levels of the tampon rose to be essentially equivalent to those observed in the vagina . however , as shown in fig2 a , the oxygen levels within a non - menstrual tampon remained essentially at atmospheric levels . as shown in fig2 b , during menstruation , the mean levels of carbon dioxide in about 50 % of the tampons exceed the carbon dioxide levels of the vaginal environment . the mean levels of oxygen within the tampon decrease with apparent loading of the menses such that about 50 % of the menstrual tampons reached an oxygen level near the ranges of oxygen levels observed in the vagina after 8 hours of wear . the decline of oxygen and the increase of carbon dioxide within a menstrual tampon may be at least partially related to microbial metabolic activity . since menses is a mixture of venous and arterial blood , some of the oxygen may be \u201c lost \u201d due to partitioning from the gas phase to the liquid phase where it binds to un - oxygenated heme molecules present in the menses . the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels observed in a menstrual tampon after prolonged wear are consistent with in vitro data showing high levels of toxin production by s . aureus under similar o 2 / co 2 conditions . phase ii provides several approaches to prevent toxin from being produced by the tsst - 1 producing strains of s . aureus . particularly , pre - toxin limiting agents are used to retard the production of bacteria produced toxins . part i . discusses oxygen scavengers incorporated into the construction of the tampon . part ii . discusses the alteration of the heme in menses . part iii . discusses the encapsulation of antimicrobial agents via hydrophilic isocyanate polymers . part iv . discusses the construction and / or additive to an absorbent structure , which either moderates ( i . e . reduces ) the thermal energy released during expansion of a tampon and / or cools the absorbent article . part v . discusses the blockage of either the production of the octapeptide ( quorum signal ) or the binding of the peptide to the cell membrane receptor . in a number of in vitro experiments , oxygen has been shown to be essential for toxin production by s . aureus . an oxygen scavenger incorporated into the construction of a tampon would significantly reduce , if not entirely prohibit , toxin production within the product . examples of oxygen scavengers , which could be employed , are antioxidants such as ascorbic acid , tocopherol and retinal . compounds such as the antioxidants used in food substances such as butylated hydroxyanisole , di - tertiary - butyl - patacresol , propyl gallate , phenylenethiourea , and aldoalpha - napthylamine could also be used . other oxygen scavenging agents employed may be composed of transition metal complexes , chelates of a salicyclic acid , salicylate salt , metal complex , and / or chelate of an organic polycarboxylic acid preferably an amino polycarboxylic acid wherein the transition metal could be supplied via the iron present in menses from the degraded heme molecules present in this body fluid . this type of oxygen scavenging molecule is typically activated by contact with water or water vapor . these same oxygen - scavenging agents have the additional benefit of moderating the ph of the tampon . because optimum toxin production occurs at a neutral ph , any agent which will lower the ph of the internal environment of the tampon into the acidic range could effectively reduce toxin production . such agents are organic acids , for example ascorbic acid , polycarboxylic acid , etc . not only does ascorbic acid act as a means to lower the ph and / or scavenge oxygen , but the ascorbic acid also deactivates the toxin . while the mechanism of deactivation is unknown , the present application includes the use of ascorbic acid in a tampon to deactivate the potential presence of tsst - 1 toxin to the point of rendering it non - toxic , i . e . not lethal in animal experiments . another approach is to alter the heme in menses such that it has a lower affinity for oxygen . this may be accomplished by placing bpg ( 2 , 3 - bisphosphoglycerate ) within the tampon . bpg lowers the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin by a factor of 26 . this is the compound used to dissociate oxygen from the heme enabling the unloading of oxygen to tissue capillaries in the body . if the oxygen can not associate with heme , it is probable that it will no longer be bioavailable to the microorganisms potentially colonizing the tampon such as s . aureus and therefore , avoid the perceived required conditions for toxin production within the tampon during menstruation . in phase i , there was a discussion of encapsulation of antimicrobial agents via hydrophilic isocyanate polymers to prevent colonization of the tampon . this same technology can be utilized to encapsulate agents which would prevent or decease the production of toxin by s . aureus . an alternative method to the isocyanate polymer encapsulation would be the use of alginates precipitated from solution . material that may be physically encapsulated includes but is not limited to carbon black , antimicrobials , oxygen scavengers ( i . e . ascorbic acid ), quorum signal analogs and / or blockers , methylene blue , chitosan malate , etc . these same compounds can be added to absorbent foams either pre - or post - polymerization . other agents which can be added include but are not limited to ascorbic acid , tocopherol , glycerol , etc ., all of which have been shown to reduce toxin production and / or deactiviate the toxin tsst - 1 . algenic acid can also be made into fibers via reaction with cellulosic fibers and provides a matrix for the additional cross - linking of a number of compounds such as chitosan malate , which is known to depress microbial growth of s . aureus and significantly reduce its ability to produce the tsst - 1 toxin . thus , alginate particles / fibers act as an active agent carrier that can be used with or in a component of the construction of an absorbent article such as a tampon to depress microbial growth of s . aureus and significantly reduce its ability to produce the tsst - 1 . iv . construction and / or additive to an absorbent structure which either moderates or reduces the thermal energy released during expansion of a tampon and / or cools the absorbent article a potential risk factor for toxin production in vivo is believed to be elevated temperature . in an attempt to moderate or depress any tendency the tampon may have to exist at an elevated temperature in vivo , a number of compounds could be used . as shown in fig3 a , in in vitro experiments a one degree fahrenheit increase in temperature can result in a 50 % increase in tsst - 1 production by s . aureus . this patent application claims any technique of construction and / or additive to an absorbent structure , which either moderates ( i . e . reduces ) the thermal energy released during expansion of a tampon and / or cools the absorbent article ( either of compressed or non - compressed construction ) such that it preferably remains at or below typical body temperature of 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . if the internal tampon temperature does rise above the ambient body temperature of 98 . 6 \u00b0 f ., it returns to 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . within 30 minutes . a number of currently marketed products are tested for their potential change in internal temperatures upon hydration , i . e . a measure of their absorbent material &# 39 ; s heat of dissolution . the experimental design involves the use of non - lubricated condoms submerged with the open end above water into a 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . water bath . a thermocouple is placed in a small hole drilled through the middle of a tampon , which is inserted into the condom such that it too is submerged into the water bath . a second thermocouple is placed between the tampon and the surrounding condom . the condom - surrounded tampon is then allowed to come to the temperature of 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . sterile saline is also allowed to come to a temperature of 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . in the same water bath . a gush of the 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . sterile saline ( at syngyna capacity ) is then pumped in such that the tampon becomes saturated . the internal and external tampon temperature is monitored . in addition to commercially available products , a tampon constructed of a super absorbent material as well as one constructed of foam absorbent material ( fam ) is tested . as shown in fig3 b , no changes were observed for the tampons \u201c external \u201d temperature . as shown in fig3 b , currently marketed products that are constructed as a compressed \u201c plug \u201d of absorbent material exhibited a sharp rise in internal temperature upon hydration with fresh menses . the thermal energy is a result of the release of expansion energy upon hydration of the compressed absorbent plug structure . referring to fig3 b , note that the temperature of the commercially available products quickly returned to water bath temperature after the action of hydration . the tampon composed of super absorbent material exhibited an internal temperature of over 2 \u00b0 f . above that of the water bath and sustained this temperature for a prolonged period of time of 7 hours . temperature increase of the super absorbent tampon may be related to the heat of dissolution of the materials used in its construction , a phenomena previously not considered in tampon construction . the foam absorbent material (\u201c fam \u201d) constructed tampon &# 39 ; s internal temperature rose only slightly and quickly returned to the original ambient temperature of 98 . 6 \u00b0 f . the epson salt or magnesium sulfate hepta - hydrate ( mgso 4 \u2014 h 2 o ) is somewhat endothermic in nature and could be employed to counteract any physical reactions to elevate temperature within the tampon . epsom salt or magnesium sulfate hepta - hydrate ( mgso 4 \u2014 h 2 o ) has a low energy of dissolution . certain absorbent materials such as psyllium husk and certain fams have been shown to moderate the temperature of a tampon under the experimental conditions outlined above such that the temperature of the tampon is not significantly elevated ( as shown in fig3 a and fig3 b ). other agents that possess zero or less than zero heats of dissolution include but are not limited to nacl , ca ( no 3 ) 2 - 4h 2 o , na 2 co 3 - 10h 2 o , cacl 2 - 6h 2 o and various other magnesium salts . an absorbent foam such as fam or another absorbent may be saturated with a solution of salt such as cacl2 , mgcl2 , or sodium ascorbate or absorbic acid and then dried leaving a residual salt or acid content within the foam . it has been found that concentrations of these materials on a weight percent of foam between 0 . 1 % and 10 % can inhibit tss - 1 production . the architecture of the tampon being either a compressed plug or a loose sack has been demonstrated to impact the internal temperature of the tampon upon hydration . the loose sack design moderates the temperature of the tampon such that its internal environment does not exceed the temperature of the body during absorption of bodily fluids . in this design cellulose could also be employed in the construction of the product to act to establish a less dense product to allow for better temperature control , i . e . body temperature or less . v . blockage of either the production of the octapeptide ( quorim signal ) or the binding of the peptide to the cell membrane receptor this patent application claims the use of such signals and / or signal analogs / antagonist , either natural or artificial in origin to repress the signal for the ultimate production of tsst - 1 by s . aureus in an absorbent article and or menstrual cup , diaphragm or other like devices . likewise any agent that can either prevent the production of the octapeptide , bind up the octapeptide after its production such that it is no longer available to \u201c feed back \u201d to the cell or occupy the binding sites on the cell membrane such that the cyclic peptide \u2014 signaling molecule octapeptide ( agr d / autinducing peptide ) can not bind and signal for toxin production in the absorbent articles . the gene cluster or operon that regulates the expressions of the toxin designated tsst - 1 is an example of quorim sensing . when an infectious agent such as s . aureus invades a host , it first attaches and attempts to grow and form a biofilm . the agr system controls the production of many secreted proteins : positively regulating enterotoxins , epidermolytic toxins and enzymes produced by staphylococci , and negatively controls such proteins such as protein a , fibronectin - binding protein and coagulase . during this time signals are sent out into the immediate environment where the biofilm is forming . when enough of this signal is present , it binds to a membrane receptor on the s . aureus cells to indicate that a critical density of bacteria has been reached and cells of s . aureus may be released into the environment to continue the process of infection . therefore , when the population of the cells is dense enough and the concentration of signal is high enough such that an individual bacterial cell can detect the signal toxin synthesis is initiated . this high level of signal is referred to , as a \u201c quorum \u201d of signal , the signal compound in the case of tsst - 1 is an octapeptide auto inducing peptide . toxin production occurs due to a cascade of phosphorylation events in response to the quorum signal within the cell that brings about the activation of the promoter region , which controls the expression of the genes encoded for the toxin . after the biofilm \u201c burst \u201d, the s . aureus cells adhere to a new site within the host and the \u201c quorum sensing \u201d process begins again . fig4 depicts the production of the octapeptide , its release into the environment and its signaling for the production of the toxin . ( arvidson , s . european conference on toxic shock , september 1997 ) as shown in fig4 , blockage of either the production of the octapeptide auto inducing peptide ( quorum signal ) or the binding of the peptide to the cell membrane receptor , could essentially lock the door to toxin production . with the use of natural repressors for tsst - 1 production such as competing analogs or antagonists peptides . therefore , this patent application claims the application of such an analog or antagonist peptide / compound to the construction of and / or as an additive to an absorbent article such as a tampon to reduce the expression of tsst - 1 toxin by s . aureus during the absorbent articles use . phase iii of this patent application claims any technique ( i . e . application of technique to an absorbent article ) or tampon construction that acts to retain / adsorb the toxin into / on the tampon preventing the toxin and / or toxin producing strains of s . aureus from coming into contact with the vaginal mucosa . to prevent any tsst - 1 toxin production from contacting the vaginal mucosa , the tampon will be designed to specifically attract and bind tsst - 1 toxin from and within the tampon from the immediate environment around the tampon or from blood / menses entering the tampon . several ways have been developed to retain the toxin in the tampon by a variety of ligand binding sites . the binding of the specific toxins onto the fiber surfaces of the tampon prevents them from contacting vaginal mucosal tissue , and thereby , is expected to provide some degree of protection to the wearer against the toxin . the toxin can be retained by a direct affinity to its own antibody or antibody fragment or a chemical hapten resembling its own binding site . specific polypeptides or fragments of polypeptides which show an affinity for the toxin can also be employed to directly link the toxin . toxins may also adhere to specific oligonucleotide sequences which create direct or combinatorial libraries and screen them for binding activity to the toxin that can identify these oligonucleotides . indirectly the toxin can be linked by saturating the environment with protein a . there are a variety of methods to attach ligands to fibers and / or materials , such as : 1 ) solid matrix support though cullulosic fibers : 2 ) activation coupling chemistry with the use of sodium periodate : 3 ) site directed antibody coupling though carbohydrates : 4 ) coupling of antibody fragments with sulfhydral residues : and 5 ) amplification of antibody binding sites such as avidin coupled matrixes or biotinylated antibodies or fragments . the above - described ligands need not only be linked to the tampon &# 39 ; s absorptive fibers / particles and / or overwrap and / or materials ( i . e . psyllium , fam , etc .). the toxin binding ligands may also be attached to non - absorptive / or absorptive glass beads , zeolites and charcoal as examples . in addition , the ligands may be attached to the inner surface of the tampon overwrap composed of formed film topsheet , 3 - d films , high loft structures , low capillary force gradients ( hollow fibers , etc .). these materials act not only as one - way flow valves , allowing flow into the tampon but not out , but also as the final \u201c net \u201d to catch the toxin before coming into contact with the vaginal mucosa . in order for the toxin to remain in the tampon once it becomes linked to a particular ligand , the ligand must be anchored to the particular absorbent or non - absorbent material composing the tampon . if the biologically active molecules is not bound or partially bound to the internal matrix of the tampon there may be a risk of the toxin coming into contact with the vaginal mucosa . here again , the one - way flow valve overwrap structure can be incorporated to the final \u201c safety net \u201d to catch any toxin or toxin complex from coming into contact with the vaginal mucosa . overwraps that isolate or trap fluid in the tampon by providing a physical separation between the fluid in the core and the top surface of the tampon or vaginal membrane are defined as \u201c one way valves .\u201d all documents cited in the detailed description of the invention are , in relevant part , incorporated herein by reference ; the citation of any document is not construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention while particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described , it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention . it is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention ."}

based sensor ( s ) image - based sensor ( s ) firmware software other implementations . motion sensing arrangement 200 provides an output to coupling arrangement 300 . coupling arrangement 300 in one example implementation comprises firmware , hardware , software and / or other implementation that performs a coupling algorithm or method to derive one or more control parameters from the sensed motion . this derived control parameters is supplied to a presentation arrangement 400 that generates a visual scene for viewing by the person who may be subject to motion sickness . the scene presentation arrangement 400 may include for example : virtual environment liquid crystal display a cathode ray tube display head mounted display projection type display holographic display other implementations . many different configurations are possible . four examples of system configurations are shown in fig2 through fig5 . in fig2 , a passenger ( p ) is shown viewing a computer - generated scene shown on a flat - panel display ( d ). the scene is being modified by coupling arrangement 300 to incorporate elements of the inertial environment that are sensed via a sensing arrangement 200 . a corresponding motion - coupled virtual environment is presented on a display 402 . in fig3 , a radar systems operator r is shown viewing an electronic display 404 . the display d is encapsulated within a window w that is moved by coupling arrangement 300 to incorporate elements of the inertial environment as sensed by sensor 200 . even though the operator r could have some access to the external environment through porthole p in this example , this is immaterial since his or her attention is focused elsewhere ( i . e ., on the display d ). in fig4 , a passenger p on an aircraft is shown using a laptop computer l having a display 406 . the computer l is shown displaying on display 404 a window of graphic / test information . the laptop runs software providing a coupling arrangement 300 that manipulates the window location to better correspond with the inertial environment as sensed by sensor 200 . although the passenger has access to an external view through a window ( w ), his or her attention is focused on the laptop or the external view may not be sufficiently evocative due to weather or lack of visual cues . in fig5 , a user ( u ) is using a simulator s for training . he or she is presented with an immersive virtual environment via an electronic display 408 . the user &# 39 ; s perspective within this virtual environment is modified by system 100 , of which the sensor package 200 is shown . again , reference to an external environment ( w ) is not of any utility in this example . many types of displays are possible . some examples are shown in fig6 a - 6e . a projector 408 may display either digital signals from a computer or television images onto a screen 409 . a virtual environment may be displayed using a head mounted display ( hmd ) 410 , a projected virtual environment such as a cave 412 or some other means . a crt or flat panel display 414 may also be used to show an immersive scene or other information window ( w ). a conventional television 415 can be used to display a windowed image that could be text , graphics or a combination . many other display types are also possible . there are a multitude of sensors and methods that can be used to monitor the inertial environment , as well as acquiring and processing the information . for any such system , the motion data would consist of some combination of translational and the rotational degrees of freedom . in most applications it will be sufficient to track the inertial components for the physically indicated motion produced by the environment . these inertial components are the main contributor to motion sickness . one example of a sensor arrangement 200 is an array of three orthogonal accelerometers . especially for slower moving platforms , such as a ship , pitch and roll may be approximated by sensing off - axis angles to the gravity normal vector , and heave , defined as vertical translation parallel to the gravity normal , may be calculated via a double integration of acceleration or via some other means . for faster moving platforms , such as an automobile or aircraft , it is sometimes desirable to sense further degrees of freedom to estimate horizontal degrees of freedom and the yaw component . this may be done , for example , by using gyroscopes or rate gyroscopes to measure rotational degrees of freedom , freeing the accelerometers or other measurement device to sense translational information . in general , an implementation of sensor arrangement 200 for acquiring the physically indicated inertial motion can combine accelerometers , gyroscopes , gps , other sensors , and information processors . an illustrative example of such an implementation is depicted in fig7 . here , a processor board 102 indicates a gyroscope 202 , an analog devices adxl202 accelerometer chips 204 a , 204 b , a led and switch connector 206 , a battery connector 208 , an rs232 or other serial port connector 210 , a rs232 converter 212 , a seeprom 214 , a pic 16c73 8 bit microcontroller 216 and operational amplifiers 218 . in the example , the sensor arrangement 200 is mounted to the motion platform with minimal mechanical compliance such that the data acquired matches the motion experienced . for more accurate motion data , the sensor should be placed in proximity to the user or users with known relative orientation . it may be calibrated to establish relative directions of motions such as front , back , left , right , etc . with respect to the user . this calibration may either take place in the factory , implying that the system is to be oriented to the user is a set manner , or it may take place at the point of use . fig8 shows an example block diagram of an illustrative non - limiting sensor arrangement 200 . accelerometers 204 or other sensors record inertial frame reference data . these data arc processed by signal conditioning hardware 218 before being input to a computer 216 , normally a microcontroller or microprocessor . the computer 216 communicates with a sepiprom memory device 214 or other memory device , which stores programming code , calibration parameters and run - time and other data in memory , or the computer 216 may use its own internal memory . the computer 216 also interacts with an rs232 serial communications system 210 , 212 or other communications system that is often power regulated to better interface with external devices . the communications system 210 , 212 transmits and receives information at a variety of baud rates . the electronics hardware is often controlled by software embedded into various devices on the hardware such as the microcontroller 216 and other devices . fig9 shows one example of how this software may operate although many other configurations are possible . once system 100 is turned on , the software begins an autostart function by waiting a set period ( block 250 ). after this period is complete , the system 100 checks to see of its registers have received a command from the offboard system such as an \u201c r \u201d or a \u201c f \u201d ( blocks 252 , 254 ). these commands , for example , would indicate that the system 100 should perform other functions ( blocks 256 , 258 ) before stopping the loop . likewise , if the auto - start mode fails ( decision block 260 ), the system will attempt to recover ( block 262 ) before stopping . assuming that the systems starts successfully , it will sample the sensors ( block 264 ), communicate data to an output port ( block 266 ) and send check sums to the microcontroller that uses these data to check for errors ( block 268 ). after completing these tasks , the system will loop back to sampling the sensors again . an example of the motion coupling arrangement 300 provides an algorithm that takes selected vectors of the physically indicated motion and generates appropriate visual scene information . the appropriate coupling algorithm may be different for different individuals . recent research has shown that humans often perceive their inertial environment incorrectly when they lack any or sufficient visual cues . since it is the perceived zineuial environment that must be rationalized with the perceived visual environment , even a perfect match of inertial and visual environments may still cause motion sickness . in these cases , it is possible to test the user in a well - controlled motion environment and record inaccurate tendencies of their proprioceptive receptors . for example , in testing subjects in a vertical linear oscillator ( vlo ), only a small percentage of the population may be able to accurately perceive their motion . of the majority of humans tested , a large number experienced a stable and predictable error in perception . other subjects , however , perceive the inertial environment as changing . for the subjects perceiving a stable environment , an exemplary instantiation may be calibrated to individual inertial sensing predilections , thus greatly accentuating the effectiveness of the system in relieving motion sickness . in addition to calibration beforehand , another possible implementation would allow for passive and non - passive feedback / control from the user . the physiological effects of motion sickness are well documented and can be monitored . using this physiological feedback , such as heart rate and / or perspiration and / or pupil dilation . etc ., the coupling algorithm would adjust to the individual . in addition , individuals can be provided with controls that allow them to adjust various parameters of the coupling algorithm , such as magnitude or motion profile of the physically indicated motion . an example of one coupling arrangement 300 is depicted in fig1 , although other instantiations are possible . such controls could be mechanical in nature , a graphical user interface ( gui ) or some other means . fig1 depicts a mechanical control panel 302 . there are two sections of control : sensitivity section 304 and cross coupling section 306 . the sensitivity section 304 controls the mapping of a given degree of freedom from the inertial reference frame to the visual . for example , an indicator 308 of + 0 . 52 for pitch would imply that the pitch output is 52 % of that input . example digital readouts 300 are shown . analog readings by the dials 310 as they point to graduated markings 312 are also possible . the user may control these sensitivity channels via knobs 314 or some other interface . cross coupling section 306 provides several channels such as roll 316 indicating the mapping from one inertial degree of freedom onto a different visual degree of freedom . for example , roll channel 316 could map partially onto yaw and heave or other degree of freedom as indicated on a scale 318 using , for example , a slide bar 320 . in general , great care should be taken in making these modifications . recent experiments have shown that some cross couplings are beneficial , while others are counterproductive . the user interface does not need to be mechanical ; it can be a graphical user interface on a computer , voice activated or many other types of interface or the coupling parameters can be preprogrammed or preset and the user interface eliminated altogether . the fig1 arrangement shows a flexible interface providing many different types of couplings and cross - couplings , but other implementations can be substantially simpler and more con strained . the coupling arrangement 300 can be implemented through hardware , software , or combination of the two . for example , hardware may be used for signal processing and conditioning , and may be complemented with firmware and software to modify and generate appropriate coupling output . in this example , the hardware provides for fast signal processing , while the firmware and software provide flexibility and a readily available interface . the display arrangement 400 will often be interfaced to the hardware via software oftentimes called a \u201c device driver .\u201d one example of such software is shown in fig1 . once the exemplary display program is first opened , it begins by initializing communications with the sensor arrangement 200 through an interface such as a serial port 210 ( block 404 ). it will then read calibration data as in 212 that are installed either at the factory or set via , the supplied user interface ( block 406 ). the software then enters a continuous loop block 214 where it is continuously reading sensor data provided by the hardware and adjusts the values for input to higher - level display software as required by the calibration parameters and other data and algorithms ( block 408 ). the exemplary implementation of system 100 may be implemented using a preset algorithm for mapping inertial motion to the visual scene , or the user may modify the mapping for personal preference using either a mechanical or graphical user interface . furthermore , the exemplary presentation arrangement 400 in certain applications does not necessarily generate an image that realistically portrays the direction of inertial motion sensed by sensor arrangement 200 . for example , it may not always be possible or even desirable for an essentially two - dimensional information display such as a radar screen , a television program , or a computer text document display to accurately depict inertial motion sensed in three - dimensions . one example mapping algorithm maps inertial heave information to display motion in the pitch direction . human subject experiments have shown that while subjects can easily perceive heave , a physically correct representation of heave in the visual environment is only rarely visually stimulating to a sufficient degree to produce the necessary correlation between visual and inertial environments . therefore , exemplary illustrative implementations of system 100 may map sensed inertial heave into the visual pitch direction , normally adjusting pitch motion to remain within 10 degrees of throw or some other range of motion . we find this produces much better results for at least some applications in terms of subjects sensing a correlation between visual and inertial environments . the frequencies that cause motion sickness symptoms are known to be centered around 0 . 2 hz , regardless of more complex , higher - frequency motions that may be superimposed . in this sense , it matters little whether the exemplary system described above is used in a land vehicle , aircraft or ship . however , illustrative non - limiting implementations can be configured to record the frequencies associated with motion sickness and electronically filter out very high frequencies associated with vibration . interim frequencies , in the 1 hz to 20 hz region have largely been ignored since they are not prevalent in either the ship or aircraft environments . on the other hand , other platforms such as military vehicles , commercial vehicles and perhaps certain types of amusement rides , generate appreciable motion energy across a much broader range of frequencies . the challenge of implementing motion - coupled visual environments in a complex motion environment involves primarily selecting the correct motions to display from the panoply of motions experienced . typically , this involves filtering or otherwise modifying higher frequencies so that the filtering process itself does not introduce conflicting visual motion . there is also the problem of displaying a workstation window , simulation or other type of visual display in a manner that leads to decreased visual - vestibular conflict . additional exemplary illustrative implementations for accomplishing this include the following : horizon - centric : the exemplary illustrative non - limiting implementations above move the display window in a manner that can be reasonably associated with a view of the horizon from the inertial environment . for example , if the vehicle pitches up , the display is moved down as if the user were focused on a point on the horizon . driver - centric : ( see fig1 ) the driver of a vehicle only rarely suffers motion sickness to the same degree as equally susceptible passengers , one possible reason for this is that the driver can anticipate motions and adjust body posture and head motion accordingly . we can place a sensor on the steering wheel and possibly even foot pedals or driver ankle to record driver motions as soon as possible . the subject display will then be adjusted to cause head and body motions similar to the driver . passenger - centric : ( see fig1 ) it is well known that head motions within an inertial environment can lead to motion sickness . another approach is to stabilize the subject &# 39 ; s head relative to a stable inertial frame to the degree possible . for this approach , a sensor can be attached to the subject &# 39 ; s head or some other body reference point , and the illustrative exemplary non - limiting implementation would cause the screen window itself to move so as to stabilize the head or body motion . simulation surround : ( see fig1 ) one of the challenges is to transfer 6 directions of freedom motion to a 2d display . a 2d visual display may not give the subject an ideal visual reference frame from which to decrease the visual - vestibular conflict . the simulation surround approach places a working window or desktop at the center of the display with an ample border of display screen around it . this border is filled with a simple motion simulation such as an aircraft flying over gridded farmland . the motion of the simulation surround is linked closely to the inertial environment so that the user always has an inertially correct visual flowfield presented in the periphery of the display . illustrative exemplary non - limiting implementations use a virtual environment such as shown in fig1 and change the viewer &# 39 ; s perspective within the environment as a means to rectify visual and vestibular senses . horizon - centric : for a desktop display of a computer screen or a tactical display , there is no visual perspective to change . instead , we will cause the viewer &# 39 ; s eye motion to move as if it were looking at an environment . this should be similarly effective in reducing or controlling the onset of motion sickness effects as use of a simulation environment . the primary challenge involved in this task is creating a window of the desktop as shown in fig1 that moves smoothly and with the desired speeds . it is also important that the mouse cursor move in conjunction with the window . the use of touch screen inputs promises to be an interesting problem . here , there are two schools of thought . in one instance , the on - screen buttons may be required to be stationary so that the user does not have to \u201c chase \u201d the buttons around the screen . on the other hand , if the user is mentally oriented to the motions outside the cockpit , he may be adjusting naturally and expecting the buttons to move . in fact , moving the buttons may itself be a way to connect cognitively the user to the actual motion of the platform . other important issues include the offset from the edge of the physical display to the reduced window . this offset is required so that the window may move within the display , but it is unclear as to how much the display needs to move to attain the desired effect . obviously , the greater the reduction in window size , the more difficult it is to incorporate all elements of a tactical display . driver - centric : ( see fig1 ) assuming that both the steering column and driver motions will be recorded , a non - limiting illustrative approach would be to use a wireless version of the sensor . fig1 shows an exemplary illustrative non - limiting implementation of a system that includes an 8 mb embedded data logger of accelerometer and gyroscope data . this system can be made wireless by use of an appropriate communications system such as the ant network radio or zigbee - compliant low - power network communications system . use of a wireless system is beneficial for ease of placement and use for sensors that must be placed on the body . passenger - centric : ( see fig1 ) stabilizing the display window relative to the driver can be accomplished using a sensing device almost identical to the one used in the horizon - centric approach . the primary difference is that display software would use the sensed inertial data to move the window so as to best stabilize the head and body motions of the user . simulation surround : ( see fig1 ) the simulation for this approach may consume relatively few computer cycles and still present a scene that is sufficiently evocative to elicit the desired effect . the sensor to be used again may resemble that for the horizon - centric approach . sensor data will be transmitted to simulation software that control the simulated scene in the window surround . the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed exemplary illustrative non - limiting implementations , but on the contrary , is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the scope of the claims ."}

ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may differ in both ( a ) surface appearance and ( b ) surface function . for example , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be constructed with at least one of a surface topography ( appearance ) and a surface composition ( function ), either of which may facilitate strength , longevity and / or a substantial fibroblastic reaction in the host tissue relative to for example the anti - adhesion biodegradable region 14 . on the other hand , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 can be constructed with at least one of a surface topography and a surface composition , either of which may facilitate , relative to the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , an anti - adhesive effect between the biodegradable surgical implant 10 and host tissues . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be formed to have an open , non - smooth and / or featured surface comprising , for example , alveoli and / or pores distributed regularly or irregularly . in further embodiments , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be formed to have , additionally or alternatively , an uneven ( e . g ., cracked , broken , roughened or flaked ) surface which , as with the above - described surfaces , may cause tissue turbulence ( e . g ., potential tissue inflammation and / or scarring ) between host tissues and the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . over time , with respect to the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , the patient &# 39 ; s fibrous and collagenous tissue may substantially completely overgrow the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , growing over and affixing the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 to the tissue . in one implementation , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 comprises a plurality of alveoli or apertures visible to the naked eye , through or over which the host tissue can grow and achieve substantial fixation . as an example , pores may be formed into the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region by punching or otherwise machining , or by using laser energy . non - smooth surfaces may be formed , for example , by abrading the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 with a relatively course surface ( e . g ., having a 40 or , preferably , higher grit sandpaper - like surface ) or , alternatively , non - smooth surfaces may be generated by bringing the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 up to its softening or melting temperature and imprinting it with a template ( to use the same example , a sandpaper - like surface ). the imprinting may occur , for example , during an initial formation process or at a subsequent time . on the other hand , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 can be formed to have a closed , continuous , smooth and / or non - porous surface . in an illustrative embodiment , at least a portion of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 is smooth comprising no protuberances , alveoli or vessel - permeable pores , so as to attenuate occurrences of adhesions between the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and host tissues . in a molding embodiment , one side of the press may be formed to generate any of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region surfaces discussed above and the other side of the press may be formed to generate an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region surface as discussed above . additional features ( e . g ., roughening or forming apertures ) may subsequently be added to further define the surface of , for example , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region . in an extrusion embodiment , one side of the output orifice may be formed ( e . g . ribbed ) to generate a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region ( wherein subsequent processing can further define the surface such as by adding transverse ribs / features and / or alveoli ) and the other side of the orifice may be formed to generate an adhesion - resistant biodegradation region surface . in one embodiment , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region is extruded to have a smooth surface and in another embodiment the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region is further processed ( e . g ., smoothed ) after being extruded . as presently embodied , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 comprises a first material , and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 comprises a second material which is different from the first material . in modified embodiments , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may comprise the same or substantially the same materials . in other embodiments , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may comprise different materials resulting from , for example , an additive having been introduced to at least one of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 can be formed to have any of the structures or dimensions disclosed in u . s . pat . no . 6 , 673 , 362 , entitled biodegradable barrier micro - membranes for attenuation of scar tissue during healing , the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference , and / or may be formed with or in combination with any of the materials described herein , preferably to facilitate tissue separation with attenuated ( e . g ., eliminated ) adhesion . according to an implementation of the present invention , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 is constructed to minimize an occurrence of adhesions of host tissues ( e . g ., internal body viscera ) to the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . in being formed to be absorbable , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 should be sufficiently non - inflammatory while being absorbed so as not to cause adhesions itself . for example , it is believed that resorption into the body too quickly of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may yield undesirable drops in local ph levels , thus possibly introducing / elevating , for example , local inflammation , discomfort and / or foreign antibody responses . as distinguished from the function ( s ) of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , an object of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 can be to attenuate tissue turbulence and any accompanying inflammation ( e . g ., swelling ). in modified embodiments , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 and the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 may be formed of the same material or relatively less divergent materials , functionally speaking , and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be used in conjunction with an anti - inflammatory gel agent applied , for example , onto the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 at a time of implantation of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . according to other broad embodiments , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 and the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 may be formed of any materials or combinations of materials disclosed herein ( including embodiments wherein the two regions share the same layer of material ) or their substantial equivalents , and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be used in conjunction with an anti - inflammatory gel agent applied , for example , onto the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 at a time of implantation of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be formed of similar and / or different materials to those set forth above , to facilitate strength , longevity and / or direct post - surgical cell colonization via , for example , invoking a substantial fibroblastic reaction in the host tissue . in an illustrated embodiment , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 is constructed to be substantially incorporated into the host tissue and / or to substantially increases the structural integrity of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . following implantation of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , body tissues ( e . g ., subcutaneous tissue and / or the exterior fascia ) commence to incorporate themselves into the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . while not wishing to be limited , it is believed that the body , upon sensing the presence of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of the present invention , is disposed to send out fibrous tissue which grows in , around and / or through and at least partially entwines itself with the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . in this manner , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 can become securely attached to the host body tissue . regarding different materials , according to an aspect of the present invention , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can comprises a biodegradable ( e . g ., resorbalbe ) polymer composition having one or more different characteristics than that or those of a biodegradable ( e . g ., resorbalbe ) polymer composition of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . the different characteristics may include ( 1a ) time or rate of biodegradation affected by additives , ( 1b ) time or rate of biodegradation affected by polymer structures / compositions , ( 2 ) polymer composition affecting strength or structural integrity , and ( 3 ) ability to facilitate fibroblastic reaction . the time or rate of biodegradation for the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be substantially greater than the rate of biodegradation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . this rate differential may be effectuated through , for example , use of ( a ) additives and / or ( b ) polymer structures / compositions . in accordance with one implementation , the characteristic is a time or rate of biodegradation influenced by the incorporation of an additive to at least one of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . in accordance with one implementation of the present invention , a rate of biodegradation of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 is substantially greater than a rate of biodegradation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . to adjust the biodegradation rate , an accelerator or retardant can be provided in one or more of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . the additive may comprise , in typical embodiments , one or more of ( i ) retardants for retarding a rate of biodegradation of a polymer when added to the polymer and ( ii ) accelerators for accelerating a rate of biodegradation of a polymer when added to the polymer . in accordance with an implementation of the present invention , retardants can be added to ( e . g ., incorporated into ) the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and / or accelerators can be added to ( e . g ., incorporated into ) the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . retardants of the present invention can include hydrophobic compounds ( i . e ., repelling , tending not to combine with , or incapable of dissolving in water ), to decrease the rate of biodegradation . agents which may serve as retardants in accordance with the present invention include non - water soluble polymers , e . g . high molecular weight methylcellulose and ethylcellulose , etc ., and low water soluble organic compounds . exemplary hydrophobic agents of an implementation of the invention may comprise compounds which have less than about 100 \u03bcg / ml solubility in water at ambient temperature . according to a broad aspect of the invention , a retardant may include any matter which is hydrophobic , wherein one implementation includes particles , for example powders or granules , which are at least partially made up of hydrophobic polymers . accelerators of the present invention can include hydrophilic compounds ( i . e ., having an affinity for , readily absorbing , or dissolving in water ), to increase the rate of biodegradation . the accelerators of the present invention may be physiologically inert , water soluble polymers , e . g . low molecular weight methyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ; sugars , e . g . monosaccharides such as fructose and glucose , disaccharides such as lactose , sucrose , or polysaccharides such as cellulose , amylose , dextran , etc . exemplary hydrophilic compounds of the invention may comprise components which have at least about 100 \u03bcg / ml solubility in water at ambient temperature . according to a broad aspect of one implementation of the present invention , an accelerator may include any matter which is hydrophilic , wherein an implementation includes particles , for example powders or granules , which comprise hydrophilic polymers . in an exemplary embodiment , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 both comprise resorbable compositions , and a resorption retarding agent ( retardant ) is provided in the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 so that the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 biodegrades at a relatively slow rate . in a modified embodiment , the retardant may also be provided in the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 at , for example , the same or a lower concentration . according to one implementation , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 biodegrades at a relatively slow rate to provide ample time for host tissues to form over and into the space occupied by the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . for example , in accordance with one aspect the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 is biodegraded ( e . g ., resorbed ) into a mammalian body within a period of about 24 months or longer from an initial implantation of the implant into the mammalian body . in one embodiment , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 loses its mechanical strength within 18 months and , preferably , within 24 months and , more preferably , with a period of or greater than 36 or 48 months from the time of implantation . in accordance with another implementation , the characteristic is a polymer composition of at least one of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . a rate of biodegradation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be relatively low and / or can be less than a rate of biodegradation of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . to obtain such a biodegradation rate , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be formed , for example , with synthesized polymers that have hydrolytically stable linkages in the backbone relative to those of faster biodegrading polymers and / or to those of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . common chemical functional groups suitable for formation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , in addition to those already described herein , can include esters , anhydrides , orthoesters , and amides . depending on the chemical structure of the polymer backbone , degradation can occur by either surface or bulk erosion . surface erosion can occur when the rate of erosion exceeds the rate of water penetration into the bulk of the polymer of either the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 or the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . this type of degradation can be obtained , for example , in oly ( anhydrides ) and poly ( ortho esters ). the hydrolysis of bulk degrading bioresorbable polymers as described herein may typically proceed by loss of molecular weight at first , followed by loss of mass in a second stage . generally , hydrolysis ( including enzyme - mediated hydrolysis ) is a preferred degradation mechanism for heterochain polymers in vivo . as an example , the degradation of poly ( \u03b5 - caprolactone ) and related polyesters such as poly ( lactide ) and its copolymers first involves non - enzymatic hydrolysis of ester linkages , autocatalyzed by the generation of carboxylic acid end groups , followed by the loss of mass . in accordance with an aspect of the present invention , lengthening of the in vivo elimination time of bioresorbable polymers can be determined by one or more of the nature of the polymer chemical linkage , the solubility of the degradation products , the size ( e . g ., thickness ), shape and density of the region or prosthesis , the drug or additive content , the molecular weight of the polymer , the extent of cross - linking of the polymer , and the implantation site . as an example , the size and form of the region or prosthesis can be used to control at least one of biodegradation time and rate . for instance , a smaller surface to mass ratio can be implemented to retard the rate of biodegradation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . a relatively thick construction of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 is believed to decelerate the absorption time or rate thereof , compared to times or rates of absorption of thinner prostheses of the same material . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of the present invention can have a uniform thickness greater than about 500 microns , or greater than about 1000 microns , and even greater than about 1500 or 3000 microns . a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of a biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 can be shaped at the time of surgery by bringing the material to its glass transition temperature , using heating iron , hot air , heated sponge or hot water bath methods . in certain embodiments , poly lactides which become somewhat rigid or brittle at greater thicknesses can be softened by formation with another polymer or copolymer , such as poly - \u03b5 - caprolactone . in modified embodiments , the poly lactides ( or other materials forming part , most or substantially all of the tissue - ingrowth region 12 ) may alternatively or additionally be combined with one or more non - biodegradable polymers , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof . more generally , in examples wherein tissue - ingrowth biodegradable regions 12 are formed by polymers ( e . g ., homo and / or copolymers ) derived from one or more cyclic esters , such as lactide ( i . e ., l , d , dl , or combinations thereof ), \u03b5 - caprolactone , and glycolide , compositions can comprise about 1 to 99 % \u03b5 - caprolactone , or 20 to 40 % \u03b5 - caprolactone , with the remainder of the polymer comprising a lactide such as poly ( l - lactide ). in modified embodiments wherein tissue - ingrowth regions 12 are formed by polymers ( e . g ., homo and / or copolymers ) derived from one or more cyclic esters and / or other materials , part or all of the tissue - ingrowth regions 12 can comprise or consist of one or more non - biodegradable polymers , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof . in further embodiments , other softening polymers ( e . g ., having low glass transition temperatures ) such as other lactones may be used with or as a substitute for \u03b5 - caprolactone . in still further embodiments , one or more non - biodegradable polymers , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof , may be used with or as a substitute for \u03b5 - caprolactone and / or other softening polymers or lactones . a preferred form of polymer for the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 is semicrystalline poly ( l - lactide ), which can have a degradation time in the order of 3 to 5 years , as compared to poly ( dl - lactide ) which degrades in 12 to 16 months . polyhydroxyacids degrade to monomeric acids and subsequently to carbon dioxide and water . these are removed from the body via respiratory routes and the kidneys ( the krebs cycle ). included among the polyesters of interest are polymers of d - lactic acid , l - lactic acid , racemic lactic acid , glycolic acid , polycaprolactone , and copolymers / combinations thereof . in modified embodiments , part or all , in any combination , of the polymer ( e . g ., polyester ) or polymers can comprise or consist of a non - biodegradable polymer , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof . by employing the l - lactate or d - lactate , for example , a slowly biodegrading polymer can be achieved for the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , while for the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 degradation may be substantially enhanced with a racemate . copolymers of lactic and glycolic acid ( poly ( lactide - co - glycolides )) can be of particular interest , wherein the rate of biodegradation can be controlled by the ratio of glycolic to lactic acid . the degradation of lactic acid and / or glycolic acid polymers in biological medium occurs exclusively by a chemical mechanism of nonspecific hydrolysis . the products of this hydrolysis are metabolized and then eliminated by the human body . chemical hydrolysis of the polymer is complete , whereby the more pronounced its amorphous character and the lower its molecular mass , the more rapidly it occurs . accordingly , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 may be formed , for example , using at least one polymer or copolymer having a less pronounced amorphous character and / or an increased molecular mass . although the most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of glycolic and lactic acid , either homopolymer is more resistant to degradation making it more suitable for formation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . biodegradation rate or time thus may be decreased , for example , in the context of forming a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , by acting on the composition of the mixture and / or on the molecular mass of the polymer ( s ). the biocompatibility of the poly ( lactide ) and poly ( lactide - co - glycolide ) polymers makes them suitable supports for cellular growth and tissue regeneration in the context of the present invention . it should also be considered that , other things being equal , the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid may also affect the brittleness of the resulting biodegradable surgical prosthesis . furthermore , the characteristic may be a strength , structural integrity , or a related parameter , wherein , for example , the effects of bulging , wrinkling and / or curling of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 may be attenuated . since the present invention seeks to allot a substantially greater proportion of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis &# 39 ; strength and structural integrity to the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , the focus of adding strength or structural integrity to the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 is directed on the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . properties which may be adjusted in accordance with the present invention to augment the mechanical performance of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 are monomer selection , polymerization and process conditions , and the presence of additives ( e . g . fillers ). these properties , in turn , can be adjusted so as to influence one or more of the hydrophilicity , crystallinity , melt and glass transition temperatures , molecular weight , molecular weight distribution , end groups , sequence distribution ( random versus block ), and the presence of residual monomer or additives in the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . furthermore , a portion or all of these properties in combination then can influence the rate of biodegradation of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . lactide is the cyclic dimer of lactic acid , which exists in three stereoisomeric forms , l - lactide , naturally occurring isomer , d - lactide and meso - lactide , which contains an l - lactyl unit and a d - lactyl unit in the ring . additionally , dl - lactide is an equimolar mixture of l - and d - lactides . in accordance with an implementation of the present invention , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 comprises poly ( l - lactide ), which has been found to exhibit high tensile strength and low elongation and consequently to have a high modulus , rendering it more suitable than many amorphous polymers for load - bearing applications such as hernia mending and sutures . poly ( l - lactide ) has a melting point around 170 \u00b0 c . and glass transition temperature in the range of 55 - 60 \u00b0 c . poly ( dl - lactide ) is an amorphous polymer ( tg 45 - 55 \u00b0 c . ), having a random distribution of both isomeric forms of lactic acid and lacking the ability to arrange into a crystalline organized structure . poly ( dl - lactide ) has a lower tensile strength , slightly higher elongation and substantially more rapid degradation time , making it more attractive for use in , for example , construction of the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . poly ( \u03b5 - caprolactone ) is a ductile semicrystalline polymer , melting in the range of 54 - 64 \u00b0 c . the glass transition temperature of \u2212 60 \u00b0 c . can be increased by copolymerisation with lactide , which also may enhance the biodegradation of the polymer . in modified embodiments , one or more non - biodegradable polymers , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof , may be combined with the poly ( \u03b5 - caprolactone ). the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of a biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention can be manufactured of biodegradable polymers by using one polymer or a polymer alloy . the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 can be strengthened by reinforcing the material with fibers manufactured from a resorbable polymer or of a polymer alloy , or with biodegradable glass fibers , such as \u03b2 - tricalsiumphosphate fibers , bio - glass fibers or cam fibers , as described in , e . g ., publication ep146398 , the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference . in modified embodiments , the surgical prosthesis 10 can be modified ( e . g ., strengthened ) by including ( e . g ., for reinforcement ) fibers or other elements manufactured from or with , in part or entirely , non - biodegradable polymers , such as , for example , one or more of ( a ) various thermoplastic resins that are polymers of , for example , propylene , ( b ) polymethacrylate , ( c ) polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ), or ( d ) combinations thereof . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 according to another aspect of the present invention can further , or alternatively , comprise or consist of at least one outer layer , which is a surface layer that improves the toughness of the implant and / or operates as a hydrolysis barrier . moreover , an interior of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 may additionally or alternatively comprise or consist of a stiffer and / or stronger layer or core . to prepare an example of such an embodiment , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis can be coated ( e . g ., brush , spray , bond , or dip coated ) with an outer layer having different chemical and mechanical properties ( e . g ., hydrolysis and / or strength retention ) than the core of the region or prosthesis . in one such case , an outer layer having greater resistance to hydrolysis than the biodegradable surgical prostheses &# 39 ; strength - enhanced core can be used , enabling the prosthesis ( after insertion in a patient ) to retain its strength and biodegrade over a longer period of time than it would have without such an outer coating or enhanced interior . according to another implementation of the present invention , the characteristic may comprise an ability to facilitate a substantial fibroblastic reaction in the host tissue . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can be constructed to facilitate a fibroblastic reaction , while the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 preferably does not cause a fibroblastic reaction . the facilitation by the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of a fibroblastic reaction can be based on one or more of the above - discussed characteristics ( e . g ., time or rate of biodegradation affected by additives , time or rate of biodegradation affected by polymer structures / compositions , and polymer composition affecting strength or structural integrity ), since the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 will need to maintain its structure long enough for reacting tissues to take a firm hold . in one embodiment , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 of the present invention can comprise or consist of at least one outer layer , which is a tissue ingrowth promoter . in another embodiment , all or substantially all of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , except for the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 , comprises a tissue ingrowth promoter . when applied to a roughened tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 comprising , for example , at least one of protuberances , alveoli and pores , the biodegradable surgical implant 10 can provide interstitial space for the host body tissue to enter by ingrowth . tissue ingrowth promoters can render the interstitial space conducive to the ingrowth therein of body tissue by providing chemically and / or physically improved surface characteristics . in accordance with one aspect of the present invention , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 may comprises a substance for cellular control , such as at least one of a chemotactic substance for influencing cell migration , an inhibitory substance for influencing cell - migration , a mitogenic growth factor for influencing cell proliferation , a growth factor for influencing cell differentiation , and factors which promote neoangiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels ). in particular implementations , one or several growth promoting factors can be introduced into or onto the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , such as fibroblast growth factor , epidermal growth factor , platelet derived growth factor , macrophage derived growth factor , alveolar derived growth factor , monocyte derived growth factor , magainin , and so forth . furthermore , one or more medico - surgically useful substances may be incorporated into or onto the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , such as those which accelerate or beneficially modify a growth or healing process . for example , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 can carry ( e . g ., via mixing during formation , implanting , or coating ) one or more therapeutic agents chosen for one or more of antimicrobial properties , capabilities for promoting repair or reconstruction and / or new tissue growth and / or for specific indications . antimicrobial agents such as broad spectrum antibiotics ( gentamicin sulphate , erythromycin or derivatized glycopeptides ) can be carried ( e . g ., via mixing during formation , implanting or coating ) to aid in combating clinical and sub - clinical infections in a tissue repair site thus facilitating ingrowth of host tissues onto and / or into the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . as an example , one or more of the above additives may be incorporated into the polymer of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 itself prior to forming the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 as part of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , for example , by addition to the polymer in suitable amounts so that at the conclusion of the polymeric particle manufacturing process , the material of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 will contain a predetermined amount of one or more of such substances which for example will be released gradually as the polymer is biodegraded . as shown in fig2 , and in accordance with a method of the present invention , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 can be used to facilitate repair of , for example , a hernia in the ventral region of a body . fig3 shows an implanted biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 having both an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 and a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 partially disposed on one side and having a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 disposed on a second side of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . the abdominal wall includes muscle 15 enclosed and held in place by an exterior fascia 16 and an interior fascia 19 . an interior layer , called the peritoneum 22 , covers the interior side of the interior fascia 19 . the peritoneum 22 is a softer , more pliable layer of tissue that forms a sack - like enclosure for the intestines and other internal viscera . a layer of skin 25 and a layer of subcutaneous fat 28 cover the exterior fascia 16 . surgical repair of a soft tissue defect ( e . g ., a hernia ) can be performed by using , for example , conventional techniques or advanced laparoscopic methods to close substantially all of a soft tissue defect . according to one implementation , an incision can be made through the skin 25 and subcutaneous fat 28 , after which the skin 25 and fat 28 can be peeled back followed by any protruding internal viscera ( not shown ) being positioned internal to the hernia . in certain implementations , an incision can be made in the peritoneum 22 followed by insertion of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 into the hernia opening so that the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 is centrally located in the hernia opening . one or both the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be attached by , e . g ., suturing to the same layer of the abdominal wall , e . g ., the relatively - strong exterior fascia 16 . alternatively , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be attached to another member , such as the interior fascia 19 and / or the peritoneum 22 . in fig3 , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 is surgically attached to the exterior fascia 16 while the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region is attached to the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and / or optionally to the exterior fascia 16 using , e . g ., heat bonding , suturing , and / or other affixation protocols disclosed herein or their substantial equivalents . those possessing skill in the art will recognize that other methods of sizing / modifying / orientating / attaching a biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 of this invention may be implemented according to the context of the particular surgical procedure . the size of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 typically will be determined by the size of the defect . use of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 in a tension - free closure may be associated with less pain and less incidence of post surgical fluid accumulation . exemplary sutures 31 and 34 may be implemented as shown to at least partially secure the biodegradable surgical prosthesis to the abdominal wall structure . the sutures 31 and 34 can be preferably implemented so that no lateral tension is exerted on the exterior fascia 16 and / or muscle 15 . when disrupted , the skin 25 and fat 28 may be returned to their normal positions , with for example the incisional edges of the skin 25 and fat 28 being secured to one another using suitable means such as subsurface sutures . in modified embodiments of the present invention , one or both of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , can be heat bonded ( or in a modified embodiment , otherwise attached , such as by suturing ). heat bonding may be achieved , for example , with a bipolar electro - cautery device , ultrasonicly welding , or similar sealing between the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 and / or directly to surrounding tissues . such a device can be used to heat the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 at various locations , such as at edges and / or at points in the middle , at least above its glass transition temperature , and preferably above its softening point temperature . the material is heated , e . g ., along with adjacent tissue , such that the two components bond together at their interface . the heat bonding may also be used initially , for example , to secure the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 to the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . since the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 serves more of a load - bearing function , a few typical embodiments may exclude heat - bonding as the sole means for securing this region to host tissues . in other embodiments , the technique of heat bonding the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 to itself or body tissue may be combined with another attachment method for enhanced anchoring . for example , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 may be temporarily affixed in position using two or more points of heat bonding using an electro - cautery device , and sutures , staples or glue can subsequently ( or in other embodiments , alternatively ) be added to secure the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 into place . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be arranged to form more than one layer or substantially one layer , or the regions may both belong to a single , integrally formed layer . for example , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the opposing adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be arranged in two layers , wherein one of the regions is disposed on top of , and opposite to , the other region . in one embodiment , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be combined on a single side of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 in , for example , substantially one layer , wherein the regions are adjacent each other on one side of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . as a slight deviation , a biodegradable surgical prosthesis having a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region on at least one ( and preferably , both ) side ( s ) thereof may be manufactured using any of the techniques described herein and , subsequently , an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region may be formed on , e . g ., one side , by smoothing , filling , or otherwise processing an area of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region with a suitable material as disclosed herein or technique ( e . g ., coating or filling with a liquid or flowable polymer composition , and / or mechanically smoothing ) to thereby form an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region having adhesion - resistant properties relative to those of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region . similarly , as depicted in fig3 , a patch of adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be sized and affixed ( e . g ., heat bonded , such as with a bipolar electro - cautery device , ultrasonicly welded , or similarly affixed ) at a time of implantation directly to at least one of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and surrounding host tissues . in modified embodiments , the affixing may be accomplished using , for example , press or adhesive bonding , or sutures . in further embodiments , at least part of the affixing may occur at a time of manufacture of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 before packaging . the patch of adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 alternatively may be partially affixed ( e . g ., using techniques enumerated in this paragraph ) at , for example , a non - perimeter or central area thereof to an area ( e . g ., a non - perimeter or central area ) of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 , so that a surgeon can trim the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 ( and / or the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 ) at a time of implantation while the adhesion - resistant biodegradable implant 14 is affixed to the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 . for instance , a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 may substantially surround an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 on one side of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , and only a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 may be formed on the other side of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . in such an implementation , the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 can be sized and shaped so as to substantially cover any opening created by the soft tissue defect , with the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable regions 12 facilitating surgical attachment to , and incorporation into , the host tissue on at least one side of , and , preferably , on both sides of , the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 . in modified embodiments , the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and / or the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 on a given surface or surfaces of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 each may be of any size or shape suited to fit the particular soft tissue defect . for example , either of the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and / or the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 on a given surface of the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 may have shapes of ovals , rectangles and various complex or other shapes wherein , for each such implementation , the two regions may have essentially the same , or different , proportions and / or dimensions relative to one another . in general , various techniques may be employed to produce the biodegradable surgical prosthesis 10 , which typically has one or two layers defining the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 . useful techniques include solvent evaporation methods , phase separation methods , interfacial methods , extrusion methods , molding methods , injection molding methods , heat press methods and the like as known to those skilled in the art . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may comprise two distinct layers or may be integrally formed together as one layer . an exemplary process for making a biodegradable surgical prosthesis of the present invention having an adhesion - resistant biodegradable region , and a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region with an additive , includes the steps of ( a ) forming a polymer layer to define the anti - adhesion biodegradable region such as described in u . s . pat . no . 6 , 673 , 362 ; ( b ) providing a water hydrolysable polymer ; ( c ) forming the hydrolysable or hydratable polymer into an implantable solid portion ; and ( d ) attaching the polymer layer to the implantable solid portion whereby the solid portion defines a tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region . the step of forming the hydrolysable polymer into an implantable solid portion can comprise adding a retardant to the hydrolysable polymer to form a mixture , followed by forming a layer from the mixture and subsequently drying and purifying the layer to form the implantable solid portion . the tissue - ingrowth biodegradable region 12 and the adhesion - resistant biodegradable region 14 may be partially or substantially entirely formed or joined together . joining can be achieved by mechanical methods , such as by suturing or by the use of metal clips , for example , hemoclips , or by other methods , such as chemical or heat bonding . the above -

port 45 which receives the stem 47 of a poppet valve , generally designated 49 , that serves to vent air into the receptacle when the plunger - type cup apparatus is elevated . the upper portion of the receptacle 23 is formed with an upwardly and readily outwardly tapered flange 52 configured for convenient receipt of a turnback engagement flange 53 formed in the upper extremity of the cup apparatus . the cup apparatus 21 is configured in its lower portion with an integral transverse wall defining the grill 27 ( fig1 ) to form a plurality of through - ports 49 arrayed thereabout and covering the majority of the transverse cross - section of the cup 33 to thereby provide for a high - volume combined flow area to provide minimal resistance to flow of fluid . the grill 27 may take numerous different forms , and in the preferred embodiment provides a combined flow area of at least 50 % of the overall cross - sectional area of the cup and preferably approximately 60 % of the overall flow area to thereby provide for the desired structural integrity while still minimizing the resistance to fluid flow upon pressurization of the filter device . with continued reference to fig1 , the grill 27 is spaced a distance upwardly about one - fifth the length of the overall cup apparatus from the bottom end 51 thereof , and is formed in its upper extremity with coarse internal female threads 53 . an upwardly opening filter cup , generally designated 57 , is received in the lower extremity of the cup apparatus and is formed with a cylindrical wall configured in its upper extremity with male threads 61 for meeting with the lower extremity of the filter cup is configured with a radially outwardly projecting rib 65 to complement a fit within a cross section of the receptacle . the filter cup 57 is formed with a lower wall defining a grill generally designated 67 . also configured throughout the majority of its transverse area with a plurality of flow ports 69 which provide a combined flow area in excess of 25 % of the overall transverse cross section of the cup apparatus and in the preferred embodiment provide a combined cross - sectional flow in excess of 50 % of the overall transverse cross - section of the cup apparatus . the grill 27 is formed centrally with an enlarged bore 60 which receives a downwardly projecting compressible stem 62 of the isolation device 31 . the stem 62 is formed on its lower extremity within an enlarged cross - section stop 64 to cooperate in securing the isolation device to the grill . the filter apparatus includes a cylindrical filter 71 which may be constructed of any desirable commercially available filter media for filtration of water such as conventional charcoal filter . the filter 71 is sandwiched between a pair of felt retainer disks 73 and 75 to provide for containment against any possibly dislodged particles , but to allow for free flow of fluid as introduced from the lower grill 67 and to pass through the upper grill 27 . the interior wall of the cup above the grill 27 is preferably formed with a cylindrical peripheral retainer rib 40 configured to cooperate with the peripheral edge of the flapper to provide for protection of the thin peripheral edges thereof . the flapper itself is in the form of a circular plate and is configured to taper radially outwardly from a thick central section to a thin peripheral edges to thereby , in the manner dictated by well - known plate stress formulas , provide for a memory tending to maintain the flexible flapper 29 by its downwardly into contacting relationship over the pores 49 of the grill 27 to provide for sealing engagement therewith , but , to , upon application of pressure from the filter chamber on the order of 15 psi or so , provide for bending of the flapper to allow the peripheral edges to be raised for high volume flow therepast to provide for rapid flow of the newly filtered liquid . the isolation device is selected and configured to provide for effective sealing thereof as described above while providing for ready flexing under upward acting pressure to thereby provide for efficient flow . as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art , the flapper is to be constructed of material which is relatively tough and resistant to high temperatures on the order of 450 degrees fahrenheit and more , as would be consistent with washing in a dishwasher or the like and to yet provide for the operation dictated by the disciplines of the present invention . a material found successful for this operation is floor silicone material , but may be one of several food - safe elastomeric materials known to those skilled in the art . it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the outer receptacle and cup apparatus may be molded of pc material and the filter cup 57 of an abs or abs blend material . in manufacture , these components may be molded separately and available for ready assembly . in one preferred embodiment , a pouring closure in the form of a cap device , generally designed 81 ( fig1 - 14 ) may be provided for snap fit onto the personal filter body assembly of the present invention as shown in fig1 . the cap device 81 is formed with a domed closure 83 configured in its lower peripheral wall with a gland 85 configured to be friction - fit over the exterior of the lip to set on the top of the combined apparatus . the cap assembly 83 may be constructed of , for instance , abs , and will be formed with an upwardly open stub drinking tube 87 covered by a friction fit plug 89 carried from a strap 90 hinged at a pivot pin 91 of an upstanding stem 93 for convenient opening and closure of the tube 87 . in manufacture , it will be appreciated that there are a minimum number of assembly steps . as an example , referring fig3 , the disk 75 may be nested down into the filter cup 57 overlying the grill 67 , the filter stacked up thereon and the disk 73 placed thereover , and the combination then fitted up into the bottom end of the cup apparatus and the filter cup 57 rotated to engage the respective threads 61 and 53 to tighten the assembly in position to slightly compress the filter media to maintain a slight pressure thereon and maintain some force on the engaged threads to facilitate closure of the filter cup into the cup apparatus . an o - ring 99 will be fitted down over the filter cup 57 to nest on the peripheral rib 65 . the umbrella isolation device 31 may be then introduced to the cup assembly from the top end thereof and the stem 62 inserted through the bore 60 to drive the conical holer 64 downwardly through such bore to compress the sides thereof , and , upon clearing the lower edge of the lower surface of the grill 27 , expand and maintain the isolation device in place . it will be appreciated that a relief bore 98 is formed in a center top of the filter to provide clearance for the fastener 64 . it will be appreciated that the diameter of the cup apparatus is of a size sufficiently smaller than the inside diameter of the receptacle such that the cup apparatus will telescope efficiently into the receptacle without binding , it being further appreciated that the o - ring 99 will provide a dynamic seal with the wall thereof . thus , the components may be easily separated and the receptacle 23 filled with , for instance , tap water , and the cup apparatus 21 introduced thereinto as guided by the flare of the bell section so as to slide conveniently downwardly in plunger fashion to contact the lower extremity thereof with the water in the receptacle as shown in fig9 and 10 . as the cup apparatus is plunged downwardly , the o - ring will prevent escape therepast of water . thus , as the apparatus is forced downwardly , causing the water to flow upwardly through the opening 69 in the grill 67 and into and through the filter device 71 to flow upwardly through the top felt discs 73 and through the ports 49 to apply a pressure underneath the reduced in thickness peripheral portions of the flap 29 , thereby applying a bending force to the diametrically outer portions thereof to thus bend the flapper and raise the edges thereof a shown in fig1 to permit a high volume flow of water as depicted by the directional arrows 101 upwardly into the cup 33 . as the full volume of water is passed upwardly through the filter device 71 , as for instance 16 ounces thereof , while the cup device is pressed downwardly through its full stroke , the cup 33 will be filled with filtered water ready for consumption . as the end of the downward stroke is reached , the other portion of the lip 51 will flex and snap over the upper edge of the bell section 51 to draw the cup apparatus into place within the receptacle for a secure joinder . the filtered water is then available for ready consumption , and , if desirable , the cap 81 ( fig1 and 14 ) may be snapped down into place over the lip 53 to close the top of the cup portion while making the filtered water available for consumption by merely lifting the lever 91 to unplug the stub tube 87 for ready access to the water . in the meantime , it will be appreciated that when the pressure in the filter chamber has been reduced , the memory of the material in the flapper will cause it to return to its horizontal position shown in fig4 to be disposed in overlying sealing relationship over the ports 49 to thus act somewhat as a check valve to prevent flow of water back downwardly and to the filter compartment . thus , in those many instances where users add energy or flavoring substances to the filtered water , the filter will be isolated from those substances to thus prevent contamination and clogging of the filter and protect the long life thereof . if desirable , the cup apparatus may be removed from the exterior receptacle and will be available for transporting the filtered water about as desired by the user . it should also be noted that , when the cup apparatus is retained in the receptacle 23 as shown in fig4 , once the filtered water has been consumed , the cup assembly 21 may be rapidly withdrawn by the user grasping the overhang of the rib 53 to draw it vertically upwardly as the wall of the cup defining the bell mouth 51 is flexed inwardly to allow for release , thereby freeing the cup assembly to be lifted relative to the receptacle . it will be appreciated that this action will cause a partial vacuum to be generated beneath the lower grill 67 , thereby applying a pressure differential across the poppet valve 49 , causing such poppet valve to be raised off its seat for introduction of atmospheric air to thereby break the partial vacuum and free the cup assembly to be drawn quickly and rapidly upwardly to be removed from the receptacle for refill of the receptacle itself . when the apparatus is emptied and it is desired to wash the cup apparatus , it can be placed directly in an automatic dishwasher or the like and tests have proven that the isolation device , filter and components will accommodate the heat and environment of such a dishwasher and will be available for subsequent . from the foregoing it will be appreciated that the self - filtering portable bottle apparatus of the present is economical to manufacture , efficient to use and offers the flexibility of allowing the user to supplement his or her drink with additives and supplements without concern for clogging the filter to thereby provide for a long and trouble free life . the invention may be embodied in other forms without departure from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof . the embodiments described therefore are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive . although the present invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments , other embodiments that are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope of the invention . accordingly , the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by reference to the appended claims ."}

substitute for the hand plate previously described in fig8 , and shown at its location within the training aid as explained in fig1 . as can be seen in fig1 , which is a left side view of the hand plate , it is of a thin line construction , and is generally made of a polymer , of a more hardened type of polymer , such as polypropylene , or any other polymer that has sufficient rigidity to act as a structural reinforcement to hold the various components of the golfer &# 39 ; s hand , and grip , in place , during a swing . as can be seen in fig1 , the hand plate 1 a has some degree of arcuateness to it , as at 1 b , so that when it is in place upon the hand of the user , as disclosed in the variety of drawings previously provided and described in this application , the hand plate will embrace that segment of the hand in the vicinity and below the thumb 13 , and extend down into the wrist area , as previously reviewed , and then extends slightly over the region of the left side of the palm , in order to prevent wrist extension , and wrist radial deviation , when the golfer undertakes the significant pressure involved in performing a golf swing , and at the same time , with this component , and the entire training aid to keep the player &# 39 ; s wrist proper in alignment , so as to avoid the various deviations as previously explained , that do occur in man golfer &# 39 ; s , regardless of their being of a beginning status , or even a somewhat experienced golfer . fig1 - 18 show what is identified as the back hand plate 1 b of this invention . essentially , it is a length of polymer , metal , or other rigid material , which has a bent upper end , as can be seen , and that particular back hand plate rest upon , obviously , that back of the hand of the user , upon installation . the back hand plate , at its location within the training aid , can be readily seen in fig5 , at reference character 1 b . the plate locates within the training device , with its slightly bent upper end biasing against the upper part of the back of the hand . this also prevents the unauthorized movement of the hand , to control the type of deviations as explained on page 6 of the specification . in this modified design , which provides for total control of the golf grip , through this training aid , generally includes all the various types of plates as identified herein . for example , the style of hand plate 1 a , or 1 , as noted within in the training aid , locates within the aid , and generally curves around the thumb edge of the hand and wrist , and has the shape and appearance as generally shown and described in fig1 - 15 . furthermore , the wrist plate 2 as can be seen embedded within the training aid , as noted in fig1 , generally locates against the lower part of the palm , just above the wrist , and then extends down into the region of the upper wrist , as located therebelow , in order to prevent flexion of the wrist at that location . furthermore , that leaves the actual palm of the hand , arranged thereabove , for clear application and gripping of the handle of the golf club , so that the wrist plate 2 provides no interference with the grip and swing of the golf club , during usage of this training aid . finally , the style of back hand plate 1 b , as shown and described in fig1 - 18 , can be seen in fig5 , resting against the back of the hand , and the upper part of the wrist , when located within the training aid . each of the various plates as identified herein fit within their own little pouch or pocket contained within the training aid , primarily to keep them in proper position . furthermore , the training aid itself is formed like a glove , having a more durable outer covering made of a heavy fabric , leather , polymer , or the like , to withstand repeated usage , while the inner layer may be of a softer type of material , for gripping purposes , and for comfort . through the use of these three combinations of plates , the training aid can help reduce and eliminate movement of the four wrist deviations , prevents wrist extension , prevents wrist radial deviation , further prevents wrist ulnar deviation , and finally , reduces wrist flexion . this provides a complete training aid to help correct the swing of the golfer , while participating in this sport . this is an example as to how this training aid , for the golfer , can be used to reduce those detriments that lead towards a poor drive or hit of the golf ball , and through the usage of this training aid , can substantially reduce if not eliminate those faults that lead to wrist extension , wrist radial deviation , wrist ulnar deviation , and wrist flexion . furthermore , while this invention has generally been described as a training aid for use by the right handed golfer , obviously , a mirror image of all of the components as previously shown , described , and explained , could be assembled into a training aid for use by the left handed golfer , and applied to his / her right hand , to provide the same benefits and enhancements to their golf swing , while participating in this popular sport . variations or modifications to the subject matter of this development may occur to those skilled in the art ; upon review of the invention as provided herein . such variations , if within the spirit of this invention , are intended to be encompassed within the scope of any claims to patent protection issuing herein . the description of the invention in the preferred embodiment , and as depicted in the drawings , are set

rather , these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete , and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art . the present invention includes a method of transforming physiological information obtained from biomedical instruments in order to use that information to modify the functioning of computer simulation or game controllers or joysticks . the invention involves modulation that transforms the controller signals received at a computer &# 39 ; s game port or a game console prior to their being used by the computer simulation or game software . the result can be that the magnitude of the effect of the game or simulation &# 39 ; s input device ( e . g ., joystick , game pad , steering wheel ) is modulated by the strength of the physiological signal ( s ). by making the joystick &# 39 ; s \u201c control authority \u201d proportional to the physiological signal ( s ), the player is encouraged to change the physiological signals ) according to a programmed criterion ( e . g ., increase , decrease , or maintain ) in order to perform better at the game task . when the physiological signal ( s ) are the target of physiological self - regulation or biofeedback training , the game play reinforces therapeutic changes in related physiological processes . however , the reinforcing feedback is preferably implicit in the task , and not explicit in the form of direct feedback ( bar graphs , tracings ), as in conventional biofeedback training . in this way , contingencies for subtle conditioning of the desirable physiological response ( s ) are set up . different embodiments of the present invention are possible , and the components of the invention can vary depending upon implementation . further , the invention is intended to be used with a variety of systems , such as standard video game systems ( e . g ., sony playstation , nintendo , etc . ), with standard personal computer systems , and with computer simulators and professional job training systems . additionally , one or more of a wide variety of different measured physiological signals can be used in accordance with the present invention , for example , eegs , skin temperature , skin conductance , heart rate , and / or event - related potentials ( erps ). u . s . pat . no . 5 , 377 , 100 , issued on dec . 27 , 1994 to pope et al , and which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety , and also specifically at column 3 , line 8 to column 5 , line 60 that details a method for determining an individual &# 39 ; s eeg index of attention , which index can be used to assess his or her mental engagement in a task . in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention , the disclosed apparatus and methods can be used specifically for entertainment purposes . for example , a player might simply use the system for the enjoyment and challenge of mastering a game or simulation , as well as the satisfaction of controlling his own physiological states . it is also within the scope of the present invention that a player could entertain himself by personally using data feedback to set challenges , thresholds and goals for the player to achieve . further , it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize a variety of input devices or controllers , as well as to utilize not just joystick or gamepad input ports , but to utilize a variety of other computer input ports as well , and thus varying the connection apparatus , as appropriate , to accommodate the type of port and / or system being utilized . the present invention could possibly utilize interface devices such as touch pads , light pens , power gloves , keyboards and weapons ( e . g ., hand - held guns ), for example . additionally , it should be noted that when the term \u201c counts \u201d has been used herein the term potentially referred to any one of a variety of types or forms of information that a computer , video game system , and / or training simulator might receive at a computer or game port . for example , it is within the scope of the present invention that the information that the computer software reads from a port could be in the form of a digital value which can be expressed as a number , counts , etc . additionally it is expressly within the scope of the present invention that substantially all of the described hardware known to the art , for example as described in u . s . pat . no . 6 , 450 , 820 , that is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein , could be replaced with software . that is to say , for example , many functions , such as comparators , timers , threshold detectors , relays , voltage controlled amplifier , voltage controlled modulator , offset circuitry , and gates , vco , baseline deviation deriving system , etc ., can be accomplished with software . for example , these functions could possibly be programmed in what is commonly known as a \u201c virtual instrument \u201d environment , such as national instruments &# 39 ; labview . in at least one embodiment , this type of environment would allow hardware used in the present invention to be replaced by functional modules represented as icons on a screen , which can be set - up and \u201c wired \u201d together . the resulting software system can then function just like its hardware counterpart , for example , interacting with external signals through analog and digital input and output boards installed in the computer . the present invention fully integrates biofeedback training into a true dynamic video game , or realistic simulation , which turns the popular home pastime of playing video games into an opportunity for therapy or self - improvement . it is the prototype of a new generation of computer game environments that train valuable mental skills beyond eye - hand coordination . current systems typically deliver biofeedback in bland , minimally motivating task formats with direct feedback . the present invention &# 39 ; s video game or task challenge format motivates trainees to participate in and adhere to the training process through the rewards inherent in mastery of popular video games or job simulators , and without the demand , monotony or frustration potential of direct concentration on physiological signals . in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention , the entertainment value and social interaction experience of electronic gameplay is enhanced by distributing the control and modulation of inputs to electronic games among two or more players , so that joint game goals are collaboratively pursued and accomplished by separate players who provide different means of control and modulation . for example , one or more player may provide physical activity control via game controller ( s ) ( these players may be termed the physical operators ) and one or more other individuals influencing the game through physiological activity measured via body sensors ( these players may be termed physiological operators ). such an embodiment avoids the problem of movement disruption of physiological sensing by modulating one player &# 39 ; s game controller using the physiological signals of another , collaborating player who is physically inactive . the invention further enables collaborative team play by multiple players with different roles on the team \u2014 one or more providing physiological mastery to facilitate game performance and one or more others simultaneously providing manual or physical skills needed to operate the game . this creates richer and more complex gaming opportunities than present games provide , enabling engaging and rewarding team social interactions among people who have different skill sets and interests or who take turns playing different roles on a team \u2014 on one hand , providing the physiological self - mastery , and on the other , providing physical performance action skills . such an embodiment modulates one or more players &# 39 ; game controller ( i . e ., game input device operated by physical activity ) using the physiological signals of another / other , collaborating player ( s ) who is / are not providing input to the game via a game controller . the invention accomplishes this function by transmitting control signals , either wired or wirelessly , derived from one or more player &# 39 ; s / players &# 39 ; physiological signals to modulate the control over the game of one or more other player / players who are using electronic game controllers , in a way that either retards or boosts game performance influence of the game controllers . alternatively , this shared influence over a game of a physiological operator and physical ( game controller ) operators , respectively , can be implemented by blending influences from both into a single control input into the game ; in this manner , game action tasks could be operated either via a game controller or particular predefined physiological input , or through pre - defined combinations of both . for instance , a video game task of an avatar game character jumping over a canyon could be initiated by either the game controller operator or by a physiological operator &# 39 ; s particular body activity , and the height or length of the jump could then be solely dependent on the physiological activity of the physiological operator whereas the direction of the jump and place of landing on the other side could be controllable only by the game controller input . thus , the physiological and game controller operators will have to collaborate to succeed at the task of jumping for good success in the game . such an embodiment may be implemented in any of the above - described game systems , simply by having one player &# 39 ; s physiological signal ( s ) sensed by the physiological signal conditioning system ( e . g ., 104 of fig1 of u . s . pat . no . 6 , 450 , 820 ) and having another player control the game controller ( s ) ( e . g ., joystick 105 of fig1 of u . s . pat . no . 6 , 450 , 820 ). such an embodiment enables two new categories of electronic game play : ( 1 ) modulating one or more player &# 39 ; s game controller input using the physiological signals of another / other collaborating individuals ; and ( 2 ) modulating game activity through joint authority over game actions by game controller input from one or more individuals and physiological sensor input from other separate individuals not using game controllers . the embodiment enables physiological and manual control of electronic games to be allocated in various combinations to several players . such an embodiment permits individuals who are physically challenged to participate in electronic game play by collaborating with a player who is able to manipulate controls that the challenged player cannot , and enables individuals with different skill sets and interests ( physiological self - control vs . physical performance skills ) to join together in rewarding game play . such an embodiment also enables implementation of unprecedented electronic games that incorporate a classic motif in superhero comics and movies in which differently - abled protagonists collaborate and / or interact , such as professor x and his cohorts in the x - men series or elijah price and david dunn in the movie \u201c unbreakable \u201d and provides opportunities for new kinds of games where the application of \u201c mental powers \u201d of particular individuals ( i . e ., particular deliberately produced eeg characteristics ) can enable or enrich the performance of other individuals playing a game . all references , including publications , patent applications , and patents , cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein . the use of the terms \u201c a \u201d and \u201c an \u201d and \u201c the \u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention ( especially in the context of the following claims ) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural , unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context . the terms \u201c comprising ,\u201d \u201c having ,\u201d \u201c including ,\u201d and \u201c containing \u201d are to be construed as open - ended terms ( i . e ., meaning \u201c including , but not limited to ,\u201d) unless otherwise noted . recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range . unless otherwise indicated herein , and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein . all methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context . the use of any and all examples , or exemplary language ( e . g ., \u201c such as \u201d) provided herein , is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed . no language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non - claimed element as essential to the practice of the invention . preferred embodiments of this invention are described herein . including the best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention . variations of those preferred embodiments may become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description . the inventors expect skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate , and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein . accordingly , this invention includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted by applicable law . moreover , any combination of the above - described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context ."}

064y and then co - transfected with baculogold \u00ae ( bd biosciences pharmingen ) baculovirus dna into sf + insect cells ( protein sciences . meriden , conn .) to generate the recombinant baculovirus containing the pcv2 orf2 gene . the new construct is provided herein as seq id no : 8 . the recombinant baculovirus containing the pcv2 orf2 gene was plaque - purified and master seed virus ( msv ) was propagated on the sf + cell line , aliquotted , and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0 c . the msv was positively identified as pcv2 orf2 baculovirus by pcr - rflp using baculovirus specific primers . insect cells infected with pcv2 orf2 baculovirus to generate msv or working seed virus express pcv2 orf2 antigen as detected by polyclonal serum or monoclonal antibodies in an indirect fluorescent antibody assay . additionally , the identity of the pcv2 orf2 baculovirus was confirmed by n - terminal amino acid sequencing . the pcv2 orf2 baculovirus msv was also tested for purity in accordance with 9 c . f . r . 113 . 27 ( c ), 113 . 28 , and 113 . 55 . each recombinant baculovirus seeded into the spinner flasks had varying multiplicities of infection ( mois ). flask 1 was seeded with 7 . 52 ml of 0 . 088 moi seed ; flask 2 was seeded with 3 . 01 ml of 0 . 36 moi seed ; flask 3 was seeded with 1 . 5 ml of 0 . 18 moi seed ; and flask 4 was seeded with 0 . 75 ml of 0 . 09 moi seed . a schematic flow diagram illustrating the basic steps used to construct a pcv2 orf2 recombinant baculovirus is provided herein as fig1 . after being seeded with the baculovirus , the flasks were then incubated at 27 \u00b1 2 \u00b0 c . for 7 days and were also agitated at 100 rpm during that time . the flasks used ventilated caps to allow for air flow . samples from each flask were taken every 24 hours for the next 7 days . after extraction , each sample was centrifuged , and both the pellet and the supernatant were separated and then microfiltered through a 0 . 45 - 1 . 0 \u03bcm pore size membrane . the resulting samples then had the amount of orf2 present within them quantified via an elisa assay . the elisa assay was conducted with capture antibody swine anti - pcv2 pab igg prot . g purified ( diluted 1 : 250 in pbs ) diluted to 1 : 6000 in 0 . 05m carbonate buffer ( ph 9 . 6 ). 100 \u03bcl of the antibody was then placed in the wells of the mictrotiter plate , sealed , and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0 c . the plate was then washed three times with a wash solution which comprised 0 . 5 ml of tween 20 ( sigma , st . louis , mo . ), 100 ml of 10 \u00d7 d - pbs ( gibco invitrogen , carlsbad , calif .) and 899 . 5 ml of distilled water . subsequently , 250 \u03bcl of a blocking solution ( 5 g carnation non - fat dry milk ( nestle , glendale , calif .) in 10 ml of d - pbs qs to 100 ml with distilled water ) was added to each of the wells . the next step was to wash the test , plate and then add pre - diluted antigen . the pre - diluted antigen was produced by adding 200 \u03bcl of diluent solution ( 0 . 5 ml tween 20 in 999 . 5 ml d - pbs ) to each of the wells on a dilution plate . the sample was then diluted at a 1 : 240 ratio and a 1 : 480 ratio , and 100 \u03bcl of each of these diluted samples was then added to one of the top wells on the dilution plate ( i . e . one top well received 100 \u03bcl of the 1 . 240 dilution and the other received 100 \u03bcl of the 1 : 480 dilution ). serial dilutions were then done for the remainder of the plate by removing 100 \u03bcl form each successive well and transferring it to the next well on the plate . each well was mixed prior to doing the next transfer . the test plate washing included washing the plate three times with the wash buffer . the plate was then sealed and incubated for an hour at 37 \u00b0 c . before being washed three more times with the wash buffer . the detection antibody used was monoclonal antibody to pcv orf2 . it was diluted to 1 : 300 in diluent solution , and 100 \u03bcl of the diluted detection antibody was then added to the wells . the plate was then sealed and incubated for an hour at 37 \u00b0 c . before being washed three times with the wash buffer . conjugate diluent was then prepared by adding normal rabbit serum ( jackson immunoresearch . west grove , pa .) to the diluent solution to 1 % concentration . conjugate antibody goat anti - mouse ( h + i )- hrp ( jackson immunoresearch ) was diluted in the conjugate diluent to 1 : 10 , 000 . 100 \u03bcl of the diluted conjugate antibody was then added to each of the wells . the plate was then sealed and incubated for 45 minutes at 37 \u00b0 c . before being washed three times with the wash buffer . 100 \u03bcl of substrate ( tmb peroxidase substrate , kirkgaard and perry laboratories ( kpl ), gaithersberg , md . ), mixed with an equal volume of peroxidase substrate b ( kpl ) was added to each of the wells . the plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes . 100 \u03bcl of 1n hcl solution was then added to all of the wells to stop the reaction . the plate was then run through an elisa reader . the results of this assay are provided in table 1 below : these results indicate that when the incubation time is extended , expression of orf2 into the supernatant of the centrifuged cells and media is greater than expression in the pellet of the centrifuged cells and media . accordingly , allowing the orf2 expression to proceed for at least 5 days and recovering it in the supernate rather than allowing expression to proceed for less than 5 days and recovering orf2 from the cells , provides a great increase in orf2 yields , and a significant improvement over prior methods . this example provides data as to the efficacy of the invention claimed herein . a 1000 ml spinner flask was seeded with approximately 1 . 0 \u00d7 10 6 sf + cells / ml in 300 ml of excell 420 media . the flask was then incubated at 27 \u00b0 c . and agitated at 100 rpm . subsequently , the flask was seeded with 10 ml of pcv2 orf2 / bac p + 6 ( the recombinant baculovirus containing the pcv2 orf2 gene passaged 6 additional times in the sf9 insect cells ) virus seed with a 0 . 1 moi after 24 hours of incubation . the flask was then incubated at 27 \u00b0 c . for a total of 6 days . after incubation , the flask was then centrifuged and three samples of the resulting supernatant were harvested and inactivated . the supernatant was inactivated by bringing its temperature to 37 \u00b1 2 \u00b0 c . to the first sample , a 0 . 4m solution of 2 - bromoethyleneamine hydrobromide which had been cyclized to 0 . 2m binary ethlylenimine ( bei ) in 0 . 3n naoh is added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of bei of 5 mm . to the second sample , 10 mm bei was added to the supernatant . to the third sample , no bei was added to the supernatant . the samples were then stirred continuously for 48 hrs . a 1 . 0 m sodium thiosulfate solution to give a final minimum concentration of 5 mm was added to neutralize any residual bei . the quantify of orf2 in each sample was then quantified using the same elisa assay procedure as described in example 1 . the results of this may be seen in table 2 below : this example demonstrates that neutralization with bei does not remove or degrade significant amounts of the recombinant pcv2 orf2 protein product . this is evidenced by the fact that there is no large loss of orf2 in the supernatant from the bei or elevated temperatures . those of skill in the art will recognize that the recovered orf2 is a stable protein product . this example demonstrates that the present invention is scalable from small scale production of recombinant pcv2 orf2 to large scale production of recombinant pcv2 orf2 . 5 . 0 \u00d7 10 5 cells / ml of sf + cells / ml in 7000 ml of excell 420 media was planted in a 20000 ml applikon bioreactor . the media and cells were then incubated at 27 \u00b0 c . and agitated at 100 rpm for the next 68 hours . at the 68 th hour , 41 . 3 ml of pcv2 orf2 baculovirus msv + 3 was added to 7000 ml of excell 420 medium . the resultant mixture was then added to the bioreactor . for the next seven days , the mixture was incubated at 27 \u00b0 c . and agitated at 100 rpm . samples from the bioreactor were extracted every 24 hours beginning at day 4 , post - infection , and each sample was centrifuged . the supernatant of the samples were preserved and the amount of orf2 was then quantified using sds - page densitometry . the results of this can be seen in table 3 below : this example tests the efficacy of seven pcv2 candidate vaccines and further defines efficacy parameters following exposure to a virulent strain of pcv2 . one hundred and eight ( 108 ) cesarean derived colostrum deprived ( cdcd ) piglets , 9 - 14 days of age , were randomly divided into 9 groups of equal size . table 4 sets forth the general study design for this example . seven of the groups ( groups 1 - 7 ) received doses of pcv2 orf2 poly peptide , one of the groups acted as a challenge control and received no pcv2 orf2 , and another group acted as the strict negative control group and also received no pcv2 orf2 . on day 0 , groups 1 through 7 were treated with assigned vaccines . piglets in group 7 were given a booster treatment on day 14 . piglets were observed for adverse events and injection site reactions following vaccination and on day 19 , piglets were moved to the second study site . at the second study site , groups 1 - 8 were group housed in one building while group 9 was housed in a separate building . all pigs received keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( klh )/ incomplete freund &# 39 ; s adjuvant ( icfa ) on days 21 and 27 and on day 24 , groups 1 - 8 were challenged with a virulent pcv2 . pre - and post - challenge , blood samples were collected for pcv2 serology . post - challenge , body weight data for determination of average daily weight gain ( adwg ), and clinical symptoms , as well as nasal swab samples to determine nasal shedding of pcv2 , were collected . on day 49 , all surviving pigs were necropsied , lungs were scored for lesions , and selected tissues were preserved in formalin for immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) testing at a later date . this was a partially blinded vaccination - challenge feasibility study conducted in cdcd pigs , 9 to 14 days of age on day 0 . to be included in the study . pcv2 ifa titers of sows were \u2266 1 : 1000 . additionally , the serologic status of sows were from a known prrs - negative herd . twenty - eight ( 28 ) sows were tested for pcv 2 serological status . fourteen ( 14 ) sows had a pcv2 titer of \u2266 1000 and were transferred to the first study site . one hundred ten ( 110 ) piglets were delivered by cesarean section surgeries and were available for this study on day \u2212 4 . on day \u2212 3 , 108 cdcd pigs at the first study site were weighed , identified with ear tags , blocked by weight and randomly assigned to 1 of 9 groups , as set forth above in table 4 . if any test animal meeting the inclusion criteria was enrolled in the study and was later excluded for any reason , the investigator and monitor consulted in order to determine the use of data collected from the animal in the final analysis . the date of which enrolled piglets were excluded and the reason for exclusion was documented . initially , no sows were excluded . a total of 108 of an available 110 pigs were randomly assigned to one of 9 groups on day \u2212 3 . the two smallest pigs ( no . 17 and 19 ) were not assigned to a group and were available as extras , if needed . during the course of the study , several animals were removed . pig 82 ( group 9 ) on day \u2212 1 , pig no . 56 ( group 6 ) on day 3 , pig no . 53 ( group 9 ) on day 4 , pig no . 28 ( group 8 ) on day 8 , pig no . 69 ( group 8 ) on day 7 , and pig no . 93 ( group 4 ) on day 9 , were each found dead prior to challenge . these six pigs were not included in the final study results . pig no 17 ( one of the extra pigs ) was assigned to group 9 . the remaining extra pig . no . 19 , was excluded from the study . the formulations given to each of the groups were as follows : group 1 was designed to administer 1 ml of viral orf2 ( vorf2 ) containing 16 \u03bcg orf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 10 . 24 ml of viral orf2 ( 256 \u03bcg / 25 \u03bcg / ml = 10 . 24 ml vorf2 ) with 3 . 2 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 2 . 56 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 1 . 6 ml of formulation for group 1 . group 2 was designed to administer 1 ml of orf2 containing 8 \u03bcg vorf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 5 . 12 ml of vorf2 ( 128 \u03bcg / 25 \u03bcg / ml = 5 . 12 ml vorf2 ) with 3 . 2 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 7 . 68 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 16 ml of formulation for group 2 . group 3 was designed to administer 1 ml of vorf2 containing 4 \u03bcg vorf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 2 . 56 ml of vorf2 ( 64 \u03bcg / 25 \u03bcg / ml = 2 . 56 ml vorf2 ) with 3 . 2 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 10 . 24 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 16 ml of formulation for group 3 . group 4 was designed to administer 1 ml of recombinant orf2 ( rorf2 ) containing 16 \u03bcg rorf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 2 . 23 ml of rorf2 ( 5 . 12 \u03bcg / 230 \u03bcg / ml = 2 . 23 ml rorf2 ) with 6 . 4 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 23 . 37 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 32 ml of formulation for group 4 . group 5 was designed to administer 0 . 1 ml of rorf2 containing 8 \u03bcg rorf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 1 . 11 ml of rorf2 ( 256 \u03bcg / 230 \u03bcg / ml = 1 . 11 ml rorf2 ) with 6 . 4 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 24 . 49 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 32 ml of formulation for group 5 . group 6 was designed to administer 1 ml of rorf2 containing 8 \u03bcg rorf2 / ml . this was done by mixing 0 . 56 ml of rorf2 ( 128 \u03bcg / 230 \u03bcg / ml = 0 . 56 ml rorf2 ) with 6 . 4 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol and 25 . 04 ml of phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 . this produced 32 ml of formulation for group 6 . group 7 was designed to administer 2 ml of pcv2 whole killed cell vaccine ( pcv2 kv ) containing the max pcv2 kv . this was done by mixing 56 ml of pcv2 kv with 14 ml of 0 . 5 % carbopol . this produced 70 ml of formulation for group 7 . finally group 8 was designed to administer klh at 0 . 5 \u03bcg / ml or 1 . 0 \u03bcg / ml per 2 ml dose . this was done by mixing 40 . 71 ml klh ( 7 . 0 \u03bcg protein / ml at 0 . 5 \u03bcg / ml = 570 ml ( 7 . 0 \u03bcg / ml )( x )=( 0 . 5 )( 570 ml )), 244 . 29 ml phosphate buffered saline at a ph of 7 . 4 , and 285 ml freunds adjuvant . table 5 describes the time frames for the key activities of this example . following completion of the in - life phase of the study , formalin fixed tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) for detection of pcv2 antigen by a pathologist ; blood samples were evaluated for pcv2 serology , nasal swab samples were evaluated for pcv2 shedding , and average daily weight gain ( adwg ) was determined from day 24 to day 49 . animals were housed at the first study site in individual cages in five rooms from birth to approximately 11 days of age ( approximately day 0 of the study ). each room was identical in layout and consisted of stacked individual stainless steel cages with heated and filtered air supplied separately to each isolation unit . each room had separate heat and ventilation , thereby preventing cross - contamination of air between rooms . animals were housed in two different buildings at the second study site . group 9 ( the strict negative control group ) was housed separately in a converted finisher building and groups 3 - 8 were housed in converted nursery building . each group was housed in a separate pen ( 1 . 1 - 12 pigs per pen ) and each pen provided approximately 3 . 0 square feet per pig . each pen was on an elevated deck with plastic slatted floors . a pit below the pens served as a holding tank for excrement and waste . each building had its own separate heating and ventilation systems , with little likelihood of cross - contamination of air between buildings . at the first study site , piglets were fed a specially formulated milk ration from birth to approximately 3 weeks of age . all piglets were consuming solid , special mixed ration by day 19 ( approximately 4\u00bd weeks of age ). at the second study site , all piglets were fed a custom non - medicated commercial mix ration appropriate for their age and weight , ad libitum . wafer at both study sites was also available ad libitum . all test pigs were treated with vitamin e on day \u2212 2 , with iron injections on day \u2212 1 and with naxcel \u00ae ( 1 . 0 ml , 1m , in alternating hams ) on days 16 , 17 , 18 and 19 . in addition . pig no . 52 ( group 9 ) was treated with an iron injection on day 3 , pig 45 ( group 6 ) was treated with an iron injection on day 11 , pig no . 69 ( group 8 ) was treated with naxcel \u00ae on day 6 , pig no . 74 ( group 3 ) was treated with dexamethazone and penicillin on day 14 , and pig no . 51 ( group 1 ) was treated with dexamethazone and penicillin on day 13 and with naxcel \u00ae on day 14 for various health reasons . while at both study sites , pigs were under veterinary care . animal health examinations were conducted on day 0 and were recorded on the health examination record form . all animals were in good health and nutritional status before vaccination as determined by observation on day 0 . all test animals were observed to be in good health and nutritional status prior to challenge . carcasses and tissues were disposed of by rendering . final disposition of study animals was records on the animal disposition record . on day 0 , pigs assigned to groups 1 - 6 received 1 . 0 ml of pcv2 vaccines 1 - 6 , respectively , 1m in the left neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 \u00bd \u2033 needle . pigs assigned to group 7 received 2 . 0 ml of pcv2 vaccine no . 7 im in the left neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 \u00bd needle . on day 14 , pigs assigned to group 7 received 2 . 0 ml of pcv2 vaccine no . 7 im in the right neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 w needle . on day 21 all test pigs received 2 . 0 ml of klh / icfa im in the right ham region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . on day 27 all test pigs received 2 . 0 ml of klh / icfa in the left ham region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . on day 24 , pigs assigned to groups 1 - 8 received 1 . 0 ml of pcv2 isuvdl challenge material ( 5 . 11 logic tcid 50 / ml ) 1m in the left neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . an additional 1 . 0 ml of the same material was administered 1n to each pig ( 0 . 5 ml per nostril ) using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and nasal canula . test pigs were observed daily for overall health and adverse events on day \u2212 4 and from day 0 to day 19 . observations were recorded on the clinical observation record . all test pigs were observed from day 0 to day 7 , and group 7 was further observed from day 14 to 21 , for injection site reactions . average daily weight gain was determined by weighing each pig on a calibrated scale on days \u2212 3 , 24 and 49 , or on the day that a pig was found dead after challenge . body weights were recorded on the body weight form . day 3 body weights were utilized to block pigs prior to randomization . day 24 and day 49 weight data was utilized to determine the average daily weight gain ( adwg ) for each pig during these time points . for pigs that died after challenge and before day 49 , the adwg was adjusted to represent the adwg from day 24 to the day of death . in order to determine pcv2 serology , venous whole blood was collected from each piglet from the orbital venous sinus on days \u2212 3 and 1 . 4 , for each piglet , blood was collected from the orbital venous sinus by inserting a sterile capillary tube into the medial canthus of one of the eyes and draining approximately 3 . 0 ml of whole blood into a 4 . 0 ml serum separator tube ( sst ). on days 24 , 31 , and 49 , venous whole blood from each pig was collected from the anterior vena cava using a sterile 18 g \u00d7 1\u00bd \u2033 vacutainer needle ( becton dickinson and company , franklin lakes , n . j . ), a vacutainer needle holder and a 13 ml sst . blood collections at each time point were recorded on the sample collection record . blood in each sst was allowed to clot , each sst was then spun down and the serum harvested . harvested serum was transferred to a sterile snap tube and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b1 10 \u00b0 c . until tested at a later date . serum samples were tested for the presence of pcv2 antibodies by bivi - r & amp ; d personnel . pigs were observed once daily from day 20 to day 49 for clinical symptoms and clinical observations were recorded on the clinical observation record . to test for pcv2 nasal shedding , on days 24 , 25 , and then every other odd numbered study day up to and including day 49 , a sterile dacron swab was inserted intra nasally into either the left or right nostril of each pig ( one swab per pig ) as aseptically as possible , swished around for a few seconds and then removed . each swab was then placed into a single sterile snap - cap tube containing 1 . 0 ml of emem media with 2 % ifbs , 500 units / ml of penicillin , 500 \u03bcg / ml of streptomycin and 2 . 5 \u03bcg / ml of fungizone . the swab was broken off in the tube , and the snap tube was sealed and appropriately labeled with animal number , study number , date of collection , study day and \u201c nasal swab .\u201d sealed snap tubes were stored at \u2212 40 \u00b1 10 \u00b0 c . until transported overnight on ice to bivi - st . joseph . nasal swab collections were recorded on the nasal swab sample collection form . bivi - r & amp ; d conducted quantitative virus isolation ( vi ) testing for pcv2 on nasal swab samples . the results were expressed in log 10 values . a value of 1 . 3 logs or less was considered negative and any value greater than 1 . 3 logs was considered positive . pigs that died ( nos . 28 , 52 , 56 , 69 , 82 , and 93 ) at the first study site were necropsied to the level necessary to determine a diagnosis . gross lesions were recorded and no tissues were retained from these pigs . at the second study site , pigs that died prior to day 49 ( nos . 45 , 23 , 58 , 35 ), pigs found dead on day 49 prior to euthanasia ( nos . 2 , 43 ) and pigs euthanized on day 49 were necropsied . any gross lesions were noted and the percentages of lung lobes with lesions were recorded on the necropsy report form . from each of the 103 pigs necropsied at the second study site , a tissue sample of tonsil , lung , heart , liver , mesenteric lymph node , kidney and inguinal lymph node was placed into a single container with buffered 10 % formalin ; while another tissue sample from the same aforementioned organs was placed into a whirl - pak ( m - tech diagnostics ltd ., thelwall , uk ) and each whirl - pak was placed on ice . each container was properly labeled . sample collections were recorded on the necropsy report form . afterwards , formalin - fixed tissue samples and a diagnostic request form were submitted for ihc testing . ihc testing was conducted in accordance with standard isu laboratory procedures for receiving samples , sample and slide preparation , and staining techniques . fresh tissues in whirl - paks were shipped with ice packs to the study monitor for storage (\u2212 70 \u00b0\u00b1 10 \u00b0 c .) and possible future use . formalin - fixed tissues were examined by a pathologist for detection of pcv2 by ihc and scored using the following scoring system : 0 = none ; 1 = scant positive staining , few sites ; 2 = moderate positive staining , multiple sites ; and 3 = abundant positive staining , diffuse throughout the tissue . due to the fact that the pathologist could not positively differentiate inguinal ln from mesenteric ln , results for these tissues were simply labeled as lymph node and the score given the highest score for each of the two tissues per animal . results for this example are given below . it is noted that one pig from group 9 died before day 0 , and 5 more pigs died post - vaccination ( 1 pig from group 4 ; 1 pig from group 6 ; 2 pigs from group 8 ; and 1 pig from group 9 ). post - mortem examination indicated all six died due to underlying infections that were not associated with vaccination or pmws . additionally , no adverse events or injection site reactions were noted with any groups . average daily weight gain ( adwg ) results are presented below in table 6 , group 9 , the strict negative control group , had the highest adwg ( 1 . 06 \u00b1 0 . 17 lbs / day ), followed by group 5 ( 0 . 94 \u00b1 0 . 22 lbs / day ), which received one dose of 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 . group 3 , which received one dose of 4 \u03bcg of vorf2 , had the lowest adwg ( 0 . 49 \u00b1 0 . 21 lbs / day ), followed by group 7 ( 0 . 50 \u00b1 0 . 15 lbs / day ), which received 2 doses of killed vaccine pcv2 serology results are presented below in table 7 . all nine groups were seronegative for pcv2 on day \u2212 3 . on day 14 , groups receiving vorf2 vaccines had the highest titers , which ranged from 187 . 5 to 529 . 2 . pigs receiving killed viral vaccine had the next highest titers , followed by the groups receiving rorf2 vaccines . groups 8 and 9 remained seronegative at this time . on day 24 and day 31 , pigs receiving vorf2 vaccines continued to demonstrate a strong serological response , followed closely by the group that received two doses of a killed viral vaccine . pigs receiving rorf2 vaccines were slower to respond serologically and groups 8 and 9 continued to remain seronegative . on day 49 , pigs receiving vorf2 vaccine , 2 doses of the killed viral vaccine and the lowest dose of rorf2 demonstrated the strongest serological responses . pigs receiving 16 \u03bcg and 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 vaccines had slightly higher ifa titers than challenge controls . group 9 on day 49 demonstrated a strong serological response . the results from the post - challenge clinical observations are presented below in table 8 . this summary of results includes observations for abnormal behavior , abnormal respiration , cough and diarrhea . table 9 includes the results from the summary of group overall incidence of clinical symptoms and table 10 includes results from the summary of group mortality rates post - challenge . the most common clinical symptom noted in this study was abnormal behavior , which was scored as mild to severe lethargy . pigs receiving the 2 lower doses of vorf2 , pigs receiving 16 \u03bcg of rorf2 and pigs receiving 2 doses of kv vaccine had incidence rates of \u2267 27 . 3 %. pigs receiving 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 and the strict negative control group had no abnormal behavior . none of the pigs in this study demonstrated any abnormal respiration . coughing was noted frequently in all groups ( 0 to 25 %), as was diarrhea ( 0 - 20 %). none of the clinical symptoms noted were pathognomic for pmws . the overall incidence of clinical symptoms varied between groups . groups receiving any of the vorf2 vaccines , the group receiving 16 \u03bcg of rorf2 , the group receiving 2 doses of kv vaccine and the challenge control group had the highest incidence of overall clinical symptoms (\u2267 36 . 4 %). the strict negative control group , the group receiving 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 and the group receiving 4 \u03bcg of rorf2 had overall incidence rates of clinical symptoms of 0 %, 8 . 3 % and 9 . 1 %, respectively . overall mortality rates between groups varied as well . the group receiving 2 doses of kv vaccine had the highest mortality rate ( 16 . 7 %); while groups that received 4 \u03bcg of vorf2 , 16 \u03bcg of rorf2 , or 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 and the strict negative control group all had 0 % mortality rates . pcv2 nasal shedding results are presented below in table 11 . following challenge on day 24 , 1 pig in group 7 began shedding pcv2 on day 27 . none of the other groups experienced shedding until day 33 . the bulk of nasal shedding was noted from day 35 to day 45 . groups receiving any of the three vorf2 vaccines and groups receiving either 4 or 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 had the lowest incidence of nasal shedding of pcv2 (\u2266 9 . 1 %). the challenge control group ( group 8 ) had the highest shedding rate ( 80 %), followed by the strict , negative control group ( group 9 ), which had an incidence rate of 63 . 6 %. the summary of group incidence of icterus . group incidence of gastric ulcers , group mean lung lesion scores , and group incidence of lung lesions are shown below in table 12 . six pigs died at the first test site during the post - vaccination phase of the study ( group 4 . n = 1 : group 6 , n = 1 ; group 8 , n = 2 ; group 9 , n = 2 ). four out of six pigs had fibrinous lesions in one or more body cavities , one pig ( group 6 ) had lesions consistent with clostridial disease , and one pig ( group 9 ) had no gross lesions . none of the pigs that died during the post - vaccination phased of the study had lesions consistent with pmws . pigs that died post - challenge and pigs euthanized on day 49 were necropsied . at necropsy , icterus and gastric ulcers were not present in any group . with regard to mean % lung lesions , group 9 had lowest mean % lung lesions ( 0 %), followed by group 1 with 0 . 40 \u00b1 0 . 50 % and group 5 with 0 . 68 \u00b1 1 . 15 %. groups 2 , 3 , 7 and 8 had the highest mean % lung lesions (\u2267 7 . 27 %). each of these four groups contained one pig with % lung lesions \u2267 71 . 5 %, which skewed the results higher for these four groups . with the exception of group 9 with 0 % lung lesions noted , the remaining 8 groups had \u2266 36 % lung lesions . almost all lung lesions noted were described as red / purple and consolidated . the summary of group ihc positive incidence results are shown in table 13 . group 1 ( vorf2 - 16 \u03bcg ) and group 5 ( rorf2 - 8 \u03bcg ) had the lowest rate of ihc positive results ( 16 . 7 %), group 8 ( challenge controls ) and group 9 ( strict negative controls ) had the highest rate of ihc positive results , 90 % and 90 . 9 %, respectively . post - challenge , group 5 , which received one dose of 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen , outperformed the other 6 vaccine groups . group 5 had the highest adwg ( 0 . 94 \u00b1 0 . 22 lbs / day ), the lowest incidence of abnormal behavior ( 0 %), the second lowest incidence of cough ( 8 . 3 %), the lowest incidence of overall clinical symptoms ( 8 . 3 %), the lowest mortality rate ( 0 %), the lowest rate of nasal shedding of pcv2 ( 8 . 3 %), the second lowest rate for mean % lung lesions ( 0 . 68 \u00b1 1 . 15 %) and the lowest incidence rate for positive tissues ( 16 . 7 %). groups receiving various levels of rorf2 antigen overall outperformed groups receiving various levels of vorf2 and the group receiving 2 doses of killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine performed the worst . tables 14 and 15 contain summaries of group post - challenge data . results of this study indicate that all further vaccine efforts should focus on a rorf2 vaccine . overall , nasal shedding of pcv2 was detected post - challenge and vaccination with a pcv2 vaccine resulted in a reduction of shedding , immunohistochemistry of selected lymphoid tissues also served as a good parameter for vaccine efficacy , whereas large differences in adwg , clinical symptoms , and gross lesions were not detected between groups . this study was complicated by the fact that extraneous pcv2 was introduced at some point during the study , as evidenced by nasal shedding of pcv2 , pcv2 seroconversion and positive ihc tissues in group 9 , the strict negative control group . seven pcv2 vaccines were evaluated in this study , which included three different dose levels of vorf2 antigen administered once on day 0 , three different dose levels of rorf2 antigen administered once on day 0 and one dose level of killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine administered on day 0 and day 14 . overall , group 5 , which received 1 dose of vaccine containing 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen , had the best results . group 5 had the highest adwg , the lowest incidence of abnormal behavior , the lowest incidence of abnormal respiration , the second lowest incidence of cough , the lowest incidence of overall clinical symptoms , the lowest mortality rate , the lowest rate of nasal shedding of pcv2 , the second lowest rate for mean % lung lesions and the lowest incidence rate for positive ihc tissues . interestingly , group 4 , which received a higher dose of rorf2 antigen than group 5 , did not perform as well or better than group 5 . group 4 had a slightly lower adwg , a higher incidence of abnormal behavior , a higher incidence of overall clinical symptoms , a higher rate of nasal shedding of pcv2 , a higher mean % lung lesions , and a higher rate for positive ihc tissues than group 5 . statistical analysis , which may have indicated that the differences between these two groups were not statistically significant , was not conducted on these data , but there was an observed trend that group 4 did not perform as well as group 5 . post - vaccination , 6 pigs died at the first study site . four of the six pigs were from group 8 or group 9 , which received no vaccine . none of the six pigs demonstrated lesions consistent with pmws , no adverse events were reported and overall , all seven vaccines appeared to be safe when administered to pigs approximately 11 days of age . during the post - vaccination phase of the study , pigs receiving either of three dose levels of vorf2 vaccine or killed whole cell vaccine had the highest ifat levels , while group 5 had the lowest ifat levels just prior to challenge , of the vaccine groups . although not formally proven , the predominant route of transmission of pcv2 to young swine shortly after weaning is believed to be by oronasal direct contact and an efficacious vaccine that reduces nasal shedding of pcv2 in a production setting would help control the spread of infection . groups receiving one of three vorf2 antigen levels and the group receiving 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 had the lowest incidence rate of nasal shedding of pcv2 ( 8 . 3 %). expectedly , the challenge control group had the highest incidence rate of nasal shedding ( 80 %). gross lesions in pigs with pmws secondary to pcv2 infection typically consist of generalized lymphadenopathy in combination with one or a multiple of the following : ( 1 ) interstitial pneumonia with interlobular edema , ( 2 ) cutaneous pallor or icterus , ( 3 ) mottled atrophic livers , ( 4 ) gastric ulcers and ( 5 ) nephritis . at necropsy , icterus , hepatitis , nephritis , and gastric ulcers were not noted in any groups and lymphadenopathy was not specifically examined for . the mean % lung lesion scores varied between groups . the group receiving 16 \u03bcg of vorf2 antigen had the lowest mean % lung lesion score ( 0 . 40 \u00b1 0 . 50 %), followed by the group that received 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 ( 0 . 68 \u00b1 1 . 15 %). as expected , the challenge control group had the highest mean % lung lesion score ( 9 . 88 \u00b1 29 . 2 %). in all four groups , the mean % lung lesion scores were elevated due to one pig in each of these groups that had very high lung lesion scores . most of the lung lesions were described as red / purple and consolidated . typically , lung lesions associated with pmws are described as tan and non - collapsible with interlobular edema . the lung lesions noted in this study were either not associated with pcv2 infection or a second pulmonary infectious agent may have been present . within the context of this study , the % lung lesion scores probably do not reflect a true measure of the amount of lung infection due to pcv2 . other researchers have demonstrated a direct correlation between the presence of pcv2 antigen , by ihc and histopathology . histopathology on select tissues was not conducted with this study . group 1 ( 16 \u03bcg of orf2 ) and group 5 ( 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 ) had the lowest incidence rate of pigs positive for pcv2 antigen ( 8 . 3 %), while group 9 ( the strict negative control group \u2014 90 . 9 %) and group 8 ( the challenge control group \u2014 90 . 0 %) had the highest incidence rates for pigs positive for pcv2 antigen . due to the non - subjective nature of this test , ihc results are probably one of the best parameters to judge vaccine efficacy on . thus , in one aspect of the present invention , the minimum portective dosage ( mpd ) of a 1 ml / l dose recombinant product with extracted pcv2 orf2 ( rorf2 ) antigen in the cdcd pig model in the face of a pcv2 challenge was determined . of the three groups that received varying levels of rorf2 antigen , group 5 ( 8 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen ) clearly had the highest level of protection . group 5 either had the best results or was tied for the most favorable results with regard to all of the parameters examined . when group 5 was compared with the other six vaccine groups post - challenge , group 5 had the highest adwg ( 0 . 94 \u00b1 0 . 22 lbs / day ), the lowest incidence of abnormal behavior ( 0 %), the second lowest incidence of cough ( 8 . 3 %), the lowest incidence of overall clinical symptoms ( 8 . 3 %), the lowest mortality rate ( 0 %), the lowest rate of nasal shedding of pcv2 ( 8 . 3 %), the second lowest rate for mean % lung lesions ( 0 . 68 \u00b1 1 . 15 %) and the lowest incidence rate for positive ihc tissues ( 16 . 7 %). in another aspect of the present invention , the mpd of a 1 ml / l dose conventional product that is partially purified pcv2 orf2 ( vorf2 ) antigen in the cdcd pig model in the face of a pcv2 challenge was determined . of the three groups that received varying levels of vorf2 antigen . group 1 ( 16 \u03bcg of vorf2 ) had the highest level of protection . group 1 outperformed groups 2 and 3 with respect to adwg , mean % lung lesions , and ihc . groups 1 and 2 ( 8 \u03bcg of vorf2 antigen ) performed equally with respect to overall incidence of clinical symptoms , group 3 ( 4 \u03bcg of vorf2 antigen ) had the lowest mortality rate , and all three groups performed equally with respect to nasal shedding . overall , vorf vaccines did not perform as well as rorf vaccines . in yet another aspect of the present invention , the efficacy of a maximum dose of a 2 ml / 2 dose conventional killed pcv2 vaccine in the cdcd pig model in the face of a pcv2 challenge was determined . of the seven vaccines evaluated in this study , the killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine performed the worst . piglets receiving two doses of killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine had the lowest adwg , the second highest rate of abnormal behavior ( 58 . 3 %), the second highest overall incidence of clinical symptoms ( 58 . 3 %), the highest mortality rate ( 16 . 7 %), the second highest , incidence of nasal shedding ( 41 . 7 %), highest mean % lung lesions ( 9 . 88 \u00b1 29 . 2 %), a high incidence of lung lesions noted ( 75 %) and a moderate ihc incidence rate in tissues ( 41 . 7 %). however , it was still effective at invoking an immune response . in still another aspect of the present invention , nasal shedding of pcv2 was assessed as an efficacy parameter and the previous pcv2 efficacy parameters from previous studies were reconfirmed . results from this study indicate that nasal shedding of pcv2 occurs following intra nasal challenge and that pcv2 vaccines reduce nasal shedding of pcv2 post - challenge . furthermore , results from this study and reports in the literature indicate that ihc should continue to be evaluated in future pcv2 vaccine trials as well . some additional conclusions arising from this study are that lymphadenopathy is one of the hallmarks of pmws . another one of the hallmarks of pmws is lymphoid depletion and multinucleated / giant histiocytes . additionally , no adverse events or injection site reactions were noted for any of the 7 pcv2 vaccines and all 7 pcv2 vaccines appeared to be safe when administered to young pigs . this example tests the efficacy of eight pcv2 candidate vaccines and reconfirms pcv2 challenge parameters from earlier challenge studies following exposure to a virulent strain of pcv2 . one hundred and fifty ( 150 ) cesarean derived colostrum deprived ( cdcd ) piglets , 6 - 16 days of age , were blocked by weight and randomly divided into 10 groups of equal size . table 16 sets forth the general study design for this example . the vaccine formulation given to each group was as follows . pcv2 vaccine no . 1 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 1 , was a high dose ( 16 \u03bcg / 2 ml dose ) of inactivated recombinant orf2 antigen adjuvanted with ims 1314 ( 16 \u03bcg rorf2 \u2014 ims 1314 ). pcv2 vaccine no . 2 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 2 , was a high dose ( 16 ug / 2 ml dose ) of a partially purified vido r - 1 generated pcv2 orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). pcv2 vaccine no . 3 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 3 , was a high dose ( 16 ug / 2 ml dose ) of inactivated recombinant orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 16 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). pcv2 vaccine no . 4 , administered at 1 \u00d7 1 ml dose to group 4 , was a high dose ( 16 ug / 1 ml dose ) of a partially purified vido r - 1 generated pcv2 orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). vaccine no . 5 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 5 , was a 4 ug / 2 ml dose of an inactivated recombinant orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 4 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). pcv2 vaccine no . 6 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 6 , was a 1 ug / 2 ml dose of an inactivated recombinant orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 1 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). pcv2 vaccine no . 7 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 7 , was a low dose ( 0 . 25 ug / 2 ml dose ) of inactivated recombinant orf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol ( 0 . 25 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ). pcv2 vaccine no . 8 , administered at 1 \u00d7 2 ml dose to group 8 , was a high dose ( pre - inactivation titer & gt ; 8 . 0 log / 2 ml dose ) inactivated conventional killed vido r - 1 generated pcv2 struve antigen adjuvanted with carbopol (& gt ; 8 . 0 log kv \u2014 carbopol ). on day 0 , groups 1 - 8 were treated with their assigned vaccines . groups 1 - 3 and 5 - 8 received boosters of their respective vaccines again on day 14 . the effectiveness of a single dose of 16 \u03bcg of vorf2 - carbopol was tested on group 4 which did not receive a booster on day 14 . piglets were observed for adverse events and injection site reactions following both vaccinations . on day 21 the piglets were moved to a second study site where groups 1 - 9 were group housed in one building and group 10 was housed in a separate building . all pigs received keyhole limpet hemocyanin emulsified with incomplete freund &# 39 ; s adjuvant ( klh / icfa ) on days 22 and 28 . on day 25 , groups 1 - 9 were challenged with approximately 4 logs of virulent pcv2 virus . by day 46 , very few deaths had occurred in the challenge control group . in an attempt to immunostimulate the pigs and increase the virulence of the pcv2 challenge material , all groups were treated with ingelvac \u00ae prrsv mlv ( porcine reproductive and respiratory vaccine , modified live virus ) on day 46 . pre - and post - challenge blood samples were collected for pcv2 serology . post - challenge , body weight data for determination of average daily weight gain ( adwg ) and observations of clinical signs were collected . on day 50 , all surviving pigs were necropsied , gross lesions were recorded , lungs were scored for pathology , and selected tissues were preserved in formalin for examination by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) for detection of pcv2 antigen at a later date . this was a partially - blind vaccination - challenge feasibility study conducted in cdcd pigs , 6 to 16 days of age on day 0 . to be included in the study , pcv2 ifa titers of sows were \u2266 1 : 1000 . additionally , the serologic status of sows were from a known prrs - negative herd . sixteen ( 16 ) sows were tested for pcv2 serological status and all sixteen ( 16 ) had a pcv2 titer of \u2266 1000 and were transferred to the first study site . one hundred fifty ( 150 ) piglets were delivered by cesarean section surgeries and were available for this study on . day \u2212 3 . on day \u2212 3 , 150 cdcd pigs at the first study site were weighed , identified with ear tags , blocked by weight and randomly assigned to 1 of 10 groups , as set forth above in table 16 . blood samples were collected from all pigs . if any test animal meeting the inclusion criteria was enrolled in the study and was later excluded for any reason , the investigator and monitor consulted in order to determine the use of data collected from the animal in the final analysis . the date of which enrolled piglets were excluded and the reason for exclusion was documented . no sows meeting the inclusion criteria selected for the study and transported to the first study site were excluded . no piglets were excluded from the study , and no test animals were removed from the study prior to termination . table 17 describes the time frames for the key activities of this example . following completion of the in - life phase of the study , formalin fixed tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) for detection of pcv2 antigen by a pathologist , blood samples were evaluated for pcv2 serology , and average daily weight gain ( adwg ) was determined from day 25 to day 50 . animals were housed at the first study site in individual cages in seven rooms from birth to approximately 11 days of age ( approximately day 0 of the study ). each room was identical in layout and consisted of stacked individual stainless steel cages with heated and filtered air supplied separately to each isolation unit . each room had separate heat and ventilation , thereby preventing cross - contamination of air between rooms . animals were housed in two different buildings at the second study site . group 10 ( the strict negative control group ) was housed separately in a converted nursery building and groups 1 - 9 were housed in a converted farrowing building . each group was housed in a separate pen ( 14 - 15 pigs per pen ) and each pen provided approximately 2 . 3 square feet per pig . groups 2 , 4 and 8 were penned in three adjacent pens on one side of the alleyway and groups 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 9 were penned in six adjacent pens on the other side of the alleyway . the group separation was due to concern by the study monitor that vaccines administered to groups 2 , 4 , and 8 had not been fully inactivated . each pen was on an elevated deck with plastic slatted , floors . a pit below the pens served as a holding tank for excrement and waste . each building had its own separate heating and ventilation systems , with little likelihood of cross - contamination of air between buildings . at the first study site , piglets were fed a specially formulated milk ration from birth to approximately 3 weeks of age . all piglets were consuming solid , special mixed ration by day 21 ( approximately 4\u00bd weeks of age ). at the second study site , all piglets were fed a custom non - medicated commercial mix ration appropriate for their age and weight , ad libitum . water at both study sites was also available ad libitum . all test pigs were treated with 1 . 0 ml of naxcel \u00ae, 1m , in alternating hams on days 19 , 20 , and 21 . in addition . pig no . 11 ( group 1 ) was treated with 0 . 5 ml , of naxcel \u00ae 1m on day 10 . pig no . 13 ( group 10 ) was treated with 1 ml of penicillin and 1 ml of predef \u00ae 2 \u00d7 on day 10 , pig no . 4 ( group 9 ) was treated with 1 . 0 ml of naxcel \u00ae 1m on day 11 , and pigs 1 ( group 1 ), 4 and 11 were each treated with 1 . 0 ml of naxcel \u00ae on day 14 for various health reasons . while at both study sites , pigs were under veterinary care . animal health examinations were conducted on day \u2212 3 and were recorded on the health examination record form . all animals were in good health and nutritional status before vaccination as determined by observation on day 0 . all test animals were observed to be in good health and nutritional status prior to challenge . carcasses and tissues were disposed of by rendering . final disposition of study animals was recorded on the animal disposition record . on days 0 and 14 , pigs assigned to groups 1 - 3 and 5 - 8 received 2 . 0 ml of assigned pcv2 vaccines 1 - 4 , respectively , 1m in the right and left neck region , respectively , using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 w needle . pigs assigned to group 4 received 1 . 0 ml of pcv2 vaccine no . 2 , 1m in the right neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 \u00bd \u2033 needle on day 0 only . on day 22 all test pigs received 2 . 0 ml , of klh / icfa 1m in the left neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . on day 28 ail test pigs received 2 . 0 ml , of klh / icfa in the right ham region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml , luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . on day 25 , pigs assigned to groups 1 - 9 received 1 . 0 ml of pcv2 isuvdl challenge material ( 3 . 98 log 10 tcid 50 / ml ) 1m in the right neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . an additional 1 . 0 ml of the same material was administered 1n to each pig ( 0 . 5 ml per nostril ) using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and nasal canula . on day 46 , all test pigs received 2 . 0 ml ingelvac \u00ae prrs mlv , 1m , in the right neck region using a sterile 3 . 0 ml luer - lock syringe and a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1 \u2033 needle . the prrsv mlv was administered in an attempt to increase virulence of the pcv2 challenge material . test pigs were observed daily for overall health and adverse events on day \u2212 3 and from day 0 to day 21 . each of the pigs was scored for normal or abnormal behavior , respiration or cough . observations were recorded on the clinical observation record . all test pigs were observed from day 0 to day 7 , and group 7 was further observed from day 14 to 21 , for injection site reactions . average daily weight gain was determined by weighing each pig on a calibrated scale on days \u2212 3 , 25 and 50 , or on the day that a pig was found dead after challenge . body weights were recorded on the body weight form . day \u2212 3 body weights were utilized to block pigs prior to randomization . day 25 and day 50 weight data was utilized to determine the average daily weight gam ( adwg ) for each pig during these time points . for pigs that died after challenge and before day 50 , the adwg was adjusted to represent the adwg from day 25 to the day of death . in order to determine pcv2 serology , venous whole blood was collected from each piglet from the orbital venous sinus on days \u2212 3 and 14 . for each piglet , blood was collected from the orbital venous sinus by inserting a sterile capillary tube into the medial canthus of one of the eyes and draining approximately 3 . 0 ml , of whole blood into a 4 . 0 ml . serum separator tube ( sst ). on days 25 , 32 , and 50 , venous whole blood from each pig was collected from the anterior vena cava using a sterile 20 g \u00d7 1\u00bd \u2033 vacutainer \u00ae needle ( becton dickinson and company , franklin lakes , n . j . ), a vaccutainer \u00ae needle holder and a 13 ml sst . blood collections at each time point were recorded on the sample collection record . blood in each sst was allowed to clot , each sst was then spun down and the serum harvested . harvested serum was transferred to a sterile snap tube and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b1 10 \u00b0 c . until tested at a later date . serum samples were tested for the presence of pcv2 antibodies by bivi - r & amp ; d personnel . pigs were observed once daily from day 22 to day 50 for clinical symptoms and scored for normal or abnormal behavior , respiration or cough . clinical observations were recorded on the clinical observation record . pigs nos . 46 ( group 1 ) and 98 ( groups 9 ) died at the first study site . both of these deaths were categorized as bleeding deaths and necropsies were not conducted on these two pigs . at the second study site , pigs that died after challenge and prior to day 50 , and pigs euthanized on day 50 , were necropsied . any gross lesions were noted and the percentages of lung lobes with lesions were recorded on the necropsy report form . from each of the pigs necropsied at the second study site , a tissue sample of tonsil , lung , heart , and mesenteric lymph node was placed into a single container with buffered 10 % formalin : while another tissue sample from the same aforementioned organs was placed into a whirl - pak \u00ae ( m - tech diagnostics ltd ., thelwall , uk ) and each whirl - pak \u00ae was placed on ice . each container was properly labeled . sample collections were recorded on the necropsy report form . afterwards , formalin - fixed tissue samples and a diagnostic request form were submitted for ihc testing . ihc testing was conducted in accordance with standard laboratory procedures for receiving samples , sample and slide preparation , and staining techniques . fresh tissues in whirl - paks \u00ae were shipped with ice packs to the study monitor for storage (\u2212 70 \u00b0\u00b1 10 \u00b0 c .) and possible future use . formalin - fixed tissues were examined by a pathologist for detection of pcv2 by ihc and scored using the following scoring system : 0 = none ; 1 = scant positive staining , few sites ; 2 = moderate positive staining , multiple sites ; and 3 = abundant positive staining , diffuse throughout the tissue . for analytical purposes , a score of 0 was considered \u201c negative ,\u201d and a score of greater than 0 was considered \u201c positive .\u201d results for this example are given below . it is noted that pigs no . 46 and 98 died on days 14 and 25 respectively . these deaths were categorized as bleeding deaths . pig no . 11 ( group 1 ) was panting with rapid respiration on day 15 . otherwise , all pigs were normal for behavior , respiration and cough during this observation period and no systemic adverse events were noted with any groups . no injection site reactions were noted following vaccination on day 0 . following vaccination on day 14 , seven ( 7 ) out of fourteen ( 14 ) group 1 pigs ( 50 . 0 %) had swelling with a score of \u201c 2 \u201d on day 15 . four ( 4 ) out of fourteen ( 14 ) group 1 ( 28 . 6 %) still had a swelling of \u201c 2 \u201d on day 16 . none of the other groups experienced injection site reactions following either vaccination . average daily weight gain ( adwg ) results are presented below in table 18 . pigs no . 46 and 98 that died from bleeding were excluded from group results . group 4 , which received one dose of 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol had the highest adwg ( 1 . 16 \u00b1 0 . 26 lbs / day ), followed by groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 10 which had adwgs that ranged from 1 . 07 \u00b1 0 . 23 lbs / day to 1 . 11 \u00b1 0 . 26 lbs / day . group 9 had the lowest adwg ( 0 . 88 \u00b1 0 . 29 lbs / day ), followed by groups 8 and 7 , which had adwgs of 0 . 93 \u00b1 0 . 33 lbs / day and 0 . 99 \u00b1 0 . 44 lbs / day , respectively . pvc2 serology results are presented below in table 19 . all ten ( 10 ) groups were seronegative for pcv2 on day \u2212 3 . on day 14 , pcv2 titers remained low for all ten ( 10 ) groups ( range of 50 - 113 ). on day 25 , group 8 , which received the whole cell killed virus vaccine , had the highest pcv2 titer ( 4617 ), followed by group 2 , which received 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol , group 4 , which received as single dose of 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol , and group 3 , which received 16 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol which had titers of 2507 , 1920 and 1503 respectively . on day 32 ( one week post challenge ), titers for groups 1 - 6 and group 8 ranged from 2360 to 7619 ; while groups 7 ( 0 . 25 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ), 9 ( challenge control ), and 10 ( strict negative control ) had titers of 382 , 129 and 78 respectively . on day 50 ( day of necropsy ), all ten ( 10 ) groups demonstrated high pcv2 titers (\u2267 1257 ). on days 25 , 32 , and 50 , group 3 , which received two doses of 16 ug rorf2 - carbopol had higher antibody titers than group 1 , which received two doses of 16 ug rorf2 \u2014 ims 1314 . on days 25 , 32 and 50 , group 2 , which received two doses of 16 ug vorf2 had higher titers than group 4 , which received only one does of the same vaccine . groups 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , which received decreasing levels of rorf2 \u2014 carbopol , of 16 , 4 , 1 , and 0 . 25 ug respectively , demonstrated correspondingly decreasing antibody titers on days 25 and 32 . the results from the post -

carbopol , and group 4 , which received one dose of 16 ug vorf2 - carbopol had tentative group diagnoses of pcv2 infection in 13 . 3 % and 6 . 7 % of each group , respectively . gastric ulcers were only diagnosed in one pig in group 7 ( 6 . 7 %); while the other 9 groups remained free of gastric ulcers . the summary of group ihc positive incidence results are shown below in table 24 , group 1 ( 16 ug rorf2 \u2014 ims 1314 ) had the lowest group rate of ihc positive results with 0 % of the pigs positive for pcv2 , followed by group 2 ( 16 ug vorf2 \u2014 carbopol ) and group 4 ( single dose 16 ug vorf2 carbopol ), which had group ihc rates of 6 . 7 % and 13 . 3 % respectively . group 9 , the challenge control group , had the highest ihc positive incidence rate with 100 % of the pigs positive for pcv2 , followed by group 10 , the strict negative control group , and group 8 ( kv vaccine ), with 93 . 3 % and 80 % of the pigs positive for pcv2 , respectively . seven pcv2 vaccines were evaluated in this example , which included a high dose ( 16 \u03bcg ) of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with ims 13 . 14 administered twice , a high dose ( 16 \u03bcg ) of vorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol administered once to one group of pigs and twice to a second group of pigs , a high dose ( 16 \u03bcg ) of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol administered twice , a 4 \u03bcg dose of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol administered twice , a 1 \u03bcg dose of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol administered twice , a low dose ( 0 . 25 \u03bcg ) of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol administered twice , and a high dose (& gt ; 8 log ) of killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine adjuvanted with carbopol . overall , group 1 , which received two doses of 16 \u03bcg rorf2 - ims 1314 , performed slightly better than groups 2 through 7 , which received vaccines containing various levels of either vorf2 or rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol and much better than group 8 , which received two doses of killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine . group 1 had the third highest adwg ( 1 . 80 \u00b1 0 . 30 lbs / day ), the lowest incidence of abnormal behavior ( 0 %), the lowest incidence of abnormal respiration ( 0 %), a low incidence of cough ( 7 . 1 %), a low incidence of overall clinical symptoms ( 7 . 1 %), was tied with three other groups for the lowest mortality rate ( 0 %), the second lowest rate for mean % lung lesions ( 0 . 15 \u00b1 0 . 34 %), the second lowest rate for pneumonia ( 21 . 4 %) and the lowest incidence rate for positive ihc tissues ( 0 %). group 1 was , however , the only group in which injection site reactions were noted , which included 50 % of the vaccinates 1 day after the second vaccination . the other vaccines administered to groups 2 through 7 performed better than the killed vaccine and nearly as well as the vaccine administered to group 1 . group 8 , which received two doses of killed pcv2 vaccine adjuvanted with carbopol , had the worst set of results for any vaccine group . group 8 had the lowest adwg ( 0 . 93 \u00b1 0 . 33 lbs / day ), the second highest rate of abnormal behavior ( 6 . 7 %), the highest rate of abnormal respiration ( 6 . 7 %), was tied with three other groups for the highest overall incidence rate of clinical symptoms ( 13 . 3 %), had the highest mortality rate of all groups ( 20 %), and had the highest positive ihc rate ( 80 %) of any vaccine group . there was concern that the killed whole cell pcv2 vaccine may not have been fully inactivated prior to administration to group 8 , which may explain this group &# 39 ; s poor results . unfortunately , definitive data was not available to confirm this concern . overall in the context of this example , a conventional killed pcv2 vaccine did not aid in the reduction of pcv2 associated disease . as previously mentioned , no adverse events were associated with the test vaccines with exception of the vaccine adjuvanted with ims 1314 . injection site reactions were noted in 50 . 0 % of the pigs 1 day after the second vaccination with the vaccine formulated with ims 1314 and in 28 . 6 % of the pigs 2 days after the second vaccination . no reactions were noted in any pigs receiving carbopol adjuvanted vaccines . any further studies that include pigs vaccinated with ims 1314 adjuvanted vaccines should continue to closely monitor pigs for injection site reactions . all pigs were sero - negative for pcv2 on day \u2212 3 and only group 2 had a titer above 100 on day 14 . on day 25 ( day of challenge ). group 8 had the highest pcv2 antibody titer ( 4619 ), followed by group 2 ( 2507 ). with the exception of groups 7 , 9 and 10 , all groups demonstrated a strong antibody response by day 32 . by day 50 , all groups including groups 7 , 9 and 10 demonstrated a strong antibody response . one of the hallmarks of late stage pcv2 infection and subsequent pmws development is growth retardation in weaned pigs , and in severe cases , weight loss is noted . average daily weight gain of groups is a quantitative method of demonstrating growth retardation or weight loss . in this example , there was not a large difference in adwg between groups . group 8 had the lowest adwg of 0 . 88 \u00b1 0 . 29 lbs / day , while group 4 had the highest adwg of 1 . 16 \u00b1 0 . 26 lb / day . within the context of thus study there was not a sufficient difference between groups to base future vaccine efficacy on adwg . in addition to weight loss \u2014 dyspnea , lethargy , pallor of the skin and sometimes icterus are clinical symptoms associated with pmws . in this example , abnormal behavior and abnormal respiration and cough were noted infrequently for each group . as evidenced in this study , this challenge model and challenge strain do not result in overwhelming clinical symptoms and this is not a strong parameter on which to base vaccine efficacy . overall , mortality rates were not high in this example and the lack of a high mortality rate in the challenge control group limits this parameter on which to base vaccine efficacy . prior to day 46 , groups 4 and 7 each had one out of fifteen pigs die . group 9 had two out of fourteen pigs die and group 8 had three out of fifteen pigs die . due to the fact that group 9 , the challenge control group was not demonstrating pcv2 clinical symptoms and only two deaths had occurred in this group by day 46 , porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus ( prrsv ) mlv vaccine was administered to all pigs on day 46 . earlier studies had utilized ingelvac \u00ae prrs mlv as an immunostimulant to exasperate pcv 2 - associated pmws disease and mortality rates were higher in these earlier studies . two deaths occurred shortly after administering the prrs vaccine on day 46 \u2014 group 4 had one death on day 46 and group 7 had one death on day 47 \u2014 which were probably not associated with the administration of the prrs vaccine . by day 50 , group 8 , which received two doses of killed vaccine , had the highest mortality rate ( 20 %), followed by group 9 ( challenge control ) and group 7 ( 0 . 25 ug rorf2 \u2014 carbopol ), with mortality rates of 14 . 3 % and 13 . 3 % respectively . overall , administration of the prrs vaccine to the challenge model late in the post - challenge observation phase of this example did not significantly increase mortality rates . gross lesions in pigs with pmws secondary to pcv2 infection typically consist of generalized lymphadenopathy in combination with one or more of the following : ( 1 ) interstitial pneumonia with interlobular edema , ( 2 ) cutaneous pallor or icterus , ( 3 ) mottled atrophic livers , ( 4 ) gastric ulcers and ( 5 ) nephritis . at necropsy ( day 50 ), icterus , hepatitis , and nephritis were not noted in any groups . a gastric ulcer was noted in one group 7 pig , but lymphadenopathy was not specifically examined for . based on the presence of lesions that were consistent with pcv2 infection , three groups had at least one pig tentatively diagnosed with pcv2 ( pmws ). group 8 , which received two doses of killed vaccine , had 20 % tentatively diagnosed with pcv2 , while group 7 and group 4 had 13 . 3 % and 6 . 7 %, respectively , tentatively diagnosed with pcv2 . the mean % lung lesion scores varied between groups at necropsy . groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 10 had low % lung lesion scores that ranged from 0 . 11 \u00b1 0 . 38 % to 0 . 90 \u00b1 0 . 15 %. as expected , group 9 , the challenge control group , had the highest mean % lung lesion score ( 10 . 81 \u00b1 23 . 27 %). in four groups , the mean % lung lesion scores were elevated due to one to three pigs in each of these groups having very high lung lesion scores . the lung lesions were red / purple and consolidated . typically , lung lesions associated with pmws are described as tan , non - collapsible with interlobular edema . the lung lesions noted in this study were either not associated with pcv2 infection or a second pulmonary infectious agent may have been present . within the context of this study , the % lung lesion scores probably do not reflect a true measure of the amount of lung infection due to pcv2 . likewise , tentative diagnosis of pneumonia may have been over - utilized as well . any pigs with lung lesions , some as small as 0 . 10 % were listed with a tentative diagnosis of pneumonia . in this example , there was no sufficient difference between groups with respect to gross lesions and % lung lesions on which to base vaccine efficacy . ihc results showed the largest differences between groups . group 1 ( 16 \u03bcg rorf2 \u2014 ims 13 . 14 ) had the lowest positive ihc results for pcv2 antigen ( 0 %); while groups 9 and had the highest positive ihc results with incidence rates of 100 % and 93 . 3 % respectively . groups 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 , which received 16 , 4 , 1 or 0 . 25 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen , respectively , adjuvanted with carbopol , had ihc positive rates of 20 %, 20 %, 40 % and 46 . 7 %, respectively . group 2 , which received two doses of 16 \u03bcg vorf2 adjuvanted with carbopol had an ihc positive rate of 6 . 7 %, while group 4 which received only one dose of the same vaccine , had an ihc positive rate of 13 . 3 %. due to the objective nature of this test and the fact that ihc results correlated with expected results , ihc testing is probably one of the best parameters on which to base vaccine efficacy . thus in one aspect of the present invention , the minimum protective dosage ( mpd ) of pcv2 rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol in the cdcd pig model in the face of a pcv2 challenge is determined groups 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 each received two doses of rorf2 antigen adjuvanted with carbopol , but the level of rorf2 antigen varied for each group . groups 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 each received 16 , 4 , 1 or 0 . 25 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen respectively . in general , decreasing the level of rorf2 antigen decreased pcv2 antibody titers , and increased the mortality rate , mean % lung lesions and the incidence of ihc positive tissues . of the lour groups receiving varying levels of rorf2 \u2014 carbopol , groups 3 and 5 , which received two doses of 16 or 4 \u03bcg of rorf2 antigen , respectively , each had an ihc positive rate of only 20 %, and each had similar antibody titers . overall , based on ihc positive results , the minimum protective dosage of rorf2 antigen administered twice is approximately 4 \u03bcg . in another aspect of the present invention , the antigenicity of recombinant ( rorf2 ) and vido r - 1 ( vorf2 ) pcv2 antigens were assessed . group 2 received two doses of 16 \u03bcg vorf2 and group 3 received two doses of 16 \u03bcg rorf2 , both vaccines were adjuvanted with carbopol . both vaccines were found to be safe and both had 0 % mortality rate . group 2 had a pcv2 antibody titer of 2507 on day 25 , while group 3 had a pcv2 antibody titer of 1503 . group 3 had a lower mean % lung lesion score than group 2 ( 0 . 11 \u00b1 0 . 38 % vs . 0 . 90 \u00b1 0 . 15 %), but group 2 had a lower ihc positive incidence rate that group 3 ( 6 . 7 % vs . 20 %). overall , both vaccines had similar antigenicity , but vorf2 was associated with slightly better ihc results . in yet another aspect , of the present invention , the suitability of two different adjuvants ( carbopol and ims 1314 ) was determined . groups 1 and 3 both received two doses of vaccine containing 16 ug of rorf2 antigen , but group 1 received the antigen adjuvanted with ims 1314 while group 3 received the antigen adjuvanted with carbopol . both groups had essentially the same adwg , essentially the same incidence of clinical signs post - challenge , the same mortality rate , and essentially the same mean % lung lesions ; but group 1 had an ihc positive rate of 0 % while group 3 had an ihc positive rate of 20 %. however , group 3 , which received the vaccine adjuvanted with carbopol had higher ifat pcv2 titers on days 25 , 32 and 50 than group 1 , which received the vaccine adjuvanted with ims 1314 . overall , although the pcv2 vaccine adjuvanted with ims 1314 did provide better ihc results , it did not provide overwhelmingly better protection from pcv2 infection and did induce injection site reaction . whereas the pcv2 vaccine adjuvanted with carbopol performed neatly as well as the ims 1314 adjuvanted vaccine , but was not associated with any adverse events . in still another aspect of the present invention , the feasibility of pcv2 orf2 as a 1 ml , 1 dose product was determined . groups 2 and 4 both received 16 \u03bcg of vorf2 vaccine adjuvanted with carbopol on day 0 , but group 2 received a second dose on day 14 . group 4 had a slightly higher adwg and a lower mean % lung lesions than group 2 , but group 2 had higher ifat pcv2 titers on day 25 , 32 and 50 , and a slightly lower incidence rate of ihc positive tissues . all other results for these two groups were similar . overall , one dose of vorf2 adjuvanted with carbopol performed similar to two doses of the same vaccine ."}

physician .", "application_number": "US-93468007-A", "description": "the present art is normally intended for use with human patients , as well as various veterinary applications . for simplicity , this combined human or animal use will be referred to as use in mammals , although of course such devices could also be used in appropriate non - mammal animals such as birds , reptiles , and amphibians , etc ., as appropriate . it should also be understood that although the examples of cutting unwanted plaque deposits in arteries are used throughout this disclosure , the actual invention may be used for a broader variety of applications , including removing tumors , getting biopsies , etc . in arteries , veins , and any other tubular or roughly tubular body lumen . for brevity , non - proximally driven rotating cutter catheters will usually be referred to in the specification as distal driven designs . however it should be understood that wherever appropriate , alternative non - proximally driven designs such as circumference driven designs are also included in this general description . nomenclature : the handle end of the catheter is the proximal location , and the nose cone tip of the catheter is the distal location . fig1 shows an overview of the device . the device typically consists of an operator handle ( 101 ) which remains outside the body . the handle may optionally contain a battery , and a motor ( 102 ) which may provides torque for a rotary cutter , and additionally one or more optional control switches ( 103 ). the catheter also has a long narrow tube ( shaft ) ( 104 ), and the cutting atherectomy head ( 105 ). the catheter tube or shaft ( 104 ) will typically consist of a flexible tube , which is often hollow and capable of passing a guide wire , as well as optionally other materials such as drugs and contrast materials , control wires , drive shafts , sensors , sensor fibers or wires , ultrasonic signals , and the like . in some embodiments , the hollow tube may contain a shaft or hollow shaft capable of transmitting torque from a motor mounted in the handle ( 102 ) to a rotary cutter ( 106 ) mounted in the atherectomy head . this rotary cutter ( 106 ) will usually be exposed to the outside environment through a window ( 107 ). the relative positions of the rotary cutter ( 106 ) and the window ( 107 ) may optionally be controlled by the operator , and optionally the cutter may be moved relative to the window edge to open or close the window ( exposing or hiding the circular cutter ) under operator control . torque may be communicated to the rotary cutter ( 106 ) by a variety of means so long as these means to not obscure either the window or the hollow space in the tube on the side of the catheter proximal to the window . some of these torque ( rotary motion ) imparting means include indirect , off - axis , mechanical gearing or other means ( 108 ). in other embodiments , the catheter tube ( 104 ) may transmit electrical power , pressure , or chemicals capable of driving an electric motor , turbine , or chemical motor which can be mounted in the atherectomy head . the head will also usually contain a flexible or moveable nose cone region or nose region ( 109 ), which in some embodiments may be connected to the rigid body of the head by one or more hinge pins or other means . this flexible nose - cone region will be capable of being deformed by the operator from a straight to a bent position so that the nose , by pressing against one wall of a body lumen , will generate an opposite force that will tend to move the cutter ( 106 ) and window ( 107 ) against an opposite wall of a body lumen , thus enabling the cutter to cut material from selected zones of a body lumen under operator control . the catheter &# 39 ; s nose ( 109 ) usually has a tapered or conical a traumatic design intended to allow the catheter head to easily migrate through arteries . it may be composed of softer materials , and may additionally have an internal coiled spring or other means to allow the tip to bend somewhat as needed to migrate through torturous arteries and other body lumen structures . fig2 a shows a close - up of the cutting atherectomy head ( 105 ). the head will typically consist of a hollow body ( 201 ) connected to the catheter tube ( 104 ), and a tapered nose , ( 109 ) usually connected to the front ( distal portion ) of the hollow body by at least one hinge ( 202 ). the head ( 105 ) will additionally consist of at least a window ( 107 ) and rotating cutting wheel ( 106 ). the unit may also optionally have holes or ports ( 203 ), ( 204 ), ( 205 ) and appropriate inner hollow spaces for accommodating an optional guide wire . this optional guide wire helps the operator thread the catheter head through torturous arteries or other body lumens , and will be discussed in more detail in fig4 . as previously discussed , prior art atherectomy catheter designs taught proximally driven rotating cutting wheel designs . that is , the rotating wheel would ( 106 ) would under previous art have been directly coupled to a drive shaft coming from catheter tube ( 104 ) by a coupling mechanism aligned with the axis of wheel ( 106 ). the prior art proximal - drive teaching had certain advantages . it was compatible with simple and robust designs , and also minimized the cross - section ( width ) of the catheter head , which was again desirable because this helped the head migrate through torturous artery channels . the prior art proximal drive design also allowed large amounts of torque to be communicated through the drive shaft to the cutting wheel by rotation , and also allowed the relative angle of the cutting wheel to be adjusted in the catheter head by transverse motion of the rotating shaft relative to the outer catheter sheath . thus an operator could , by transverse motion of the catheter &# 39 ; s inner rotating shaft , both communicate rotation to the cutting head , and also adjust the cutting head &# 39 ; s relative orientation to catheter head windows ( opening and closing the window , for example ) or alternatively , in fixed window designs , adjust the angle of the cutting head or control to what extent the cutting head protrudes out through a catheter window . however , as previously discussed , the prior art proximal design had one big drawback . the drawback was that proximal drive rotary shaft and coupling mechanism occupied essentially all of the hollow space ( 206 ) in the inside of the catheter head ( i . e . proximal to the window ( 107 ) and cutter ( 106 ). as a result , in prior art designs , the only space that was available to store cutter shavings ( typically plaque shavings ) was in the hollow nosecone ( 109 ). unfortunately this hollow nosecone , which needed to be tapered in order to pass easily through arteries , typically had very limited internal volume and storage capacity . examples of such proximally driven cutters that store plaque shavings in the distal side in a conical nose include the previously discussed silverhawk device . as previously discussed , this prior art device , although very functional , filled up quickly with shavings . when this happened , the device had to be stopped , removed from the body , the contents of the nose removed , and then reinserted into the body and threaded to the correct region again . as previously discussed , this was undesirable because it extended the length of procedures , and was burdensome for the physician and patient . as previously discussed , by departing from the mechanically simpler proximally driven designs of prior art , and instead moving to a mechanically more complex non - proximally driven design ( such as a distally driven or circumference driven design ), the substantially larger space ( 206 ) on the proximal side of the cutter wheel ( 106 ) can now be opened up and used to store plaque shavings . although due to the higher complexity , previous designs taught away from such configurations , this more complex design is justified by the subsequent savings in catheter cleaning time and effort . whereas earlier designs , due to limited nosecone plaque storage space ( 109 ), could potentially waste hours of physician and patient times through tedious multiple removal and cleaning steps , these wasted hours can now be reduced or eliminated . the additional time can be used to do a more complete job of plaque removal as needed . given the extremely small diameter available to catheters , however , this alternative design poses many challenges . either the rotating cutting wheel needs to be coupled to its rotational power source by an indirect linkage , or alternatively the cutting wheel needs to be powered from the distal end . various types of indirect linkage are possible , and the present invention is not intended to be limited to any one means . in one embodiment of the invention , the mechanism may involve indirectly coup ling the cutting wheel ( 106 ) to the torque or rotation transmitting catheter drive shaft from the catheter tube ( 104 ) by an indirect gearing means so that torque is transmitted from the drive shaft to the outer diameter of the cutting wheel from the distal direction . in one example , a rotating drive shaft from the flexible catheter tube ( 104 ) turns a first axial aligned gear ( 210 ) which , through one or more transfer gears ( 211 ), transfers power to an off - axial drive shaft ( 212 ). this off - axial drive shaft ( 212 ), typically will be connected closely to the main body of the catheter head ( 201 ) by a coupling mechanism ( not shown ) that allows the drive shaft to rotate . off - axial drive shaft ( 212 ) then transfers power to the rotating cutter ( 106 ) by a second gearing mechanism ( 213 ). many other mechanisms are also possible , and these are discussed in more detail in fig5 . a second advantage of the present invention &# 39 ; s distal side driven design over the earlier proximal driven art is that the distal driven design allows the cutter wheel ( 106 ) to be mounted on a carriage mechanism ( not shown ) so that it can also be used to open and close the window ( 107 ) as directed by the operator . this can allow the cutter wheel to be gradually closed by the operator , so as to allow simultaneously shearing off and trapping any dangling plaque that still may be attached to the side of an artery wall . as per the earlier silverhawk catheter designs , usually , the angle of the present art catheter &# 39 ; s nose ( 109 ), relative to the rest of the catheter head body ( 201 ), will be under the control of the operator so as to act to press the cutting wheel against the target plaque with the desired degree of pressure . as per the earlier silverhawk catheter design , plaque cutting can be facilitated by deflecting the cutting wheel ( 106 ) so that it protrudes slightly through the window ( 107 ). this way the exposed tip of the cutting wheel may freely shave away stiff regions of exposed plaque that might not otherwise bend to extend inside the catheter window . this deflection may be achieved by a cam mechanism ( not shown ). cam mechanisms of this type were previously taught by applications ser . nos . 10 / 896 , 741 ; 10 / 288 , 559 ; 10 / 027 , 418 , the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference . the rotating cutting wheel may have sharp edges composed of tungsten carbide and the like . in other configurations , a wheel need not be used , and instead an alternate cutting device such as laser , radio frequency electrodes , ultrasonic vibrating knives , may be used . in still other configurations , a cutting wheel can have its cutting effectiveness enhanced by coupling its rotary cutting action with laser , radio frequency electrodes , ultrasonic vibration , and the like as needed . device dimensions : typically the catheter cutting head ( 201 ) will have a diameter between about 1 to 2 . 2 millimeters . the cutting window ( 107 ) will typically have a length of about 1 . 2 to 2 . 5 millimeters . in embodiments where the cutting wheel contains a cam or other orientation control mechanism that allows the wheel to extend slightly outside the window , the wheel orientation control mechanism may allow the wheel to at least temporarily be locked into a position that allows the cutting outer edge of the wheel to extend about 0 . 025 to 0 . 64 mm outside the cutting window . this allows the operator to move the catheter head along the target region of plaque , and shave off a long thin portion of this plaque while doing so . the cutting wheel ( 106 ) will typically have a diameter of about 1 . 14 mm , and may have a straight edge , a beveled edge ( which allows removal of plaque without damaging the underlying artery lumen ), or a fluted edge depending upon the needs of the specific application . usually the cutting wheel will be mounted on a shuttle or cam mechanism to allow the operator to adjust the protrusion of the wheel from the window , or alternatively the angle of the wheel or even the location of the wheel relative to the window opening ( causing the window to be open , partially closed , or fully closed by the wheel ). the cutting wheel will typically rotate at speeds appreciably faster than 100 rotations per minute ( rpm ), preferably about 8 , 000 rotations per minute ( rpm ). the cutting edge of the blades may be optionally hardened by an appropriate coating , such as me - 92 , tungsten carbide , or other suitable materials as taught by u . s . pat . nos . 4 , 771 , 774 ; 5 , 242 , 460 ; 5 , 312 , 425 ; 5 , 431 , 673 ; and 5 , 674 , 232 , the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference . as previously discussed , the action of blade can be facilitated by ultrasonic vibration , laser cutting , radio frequency electrodes , and the like . if this option is elected , appropriate mechanisms ( i . e . a piezoelectric ultrasonic vibrator , laser diode or optical fiber , electrodes , etc .) may also be provided in the catheter head to drive the blade as needed . if the action of the ultrasonic , laser , or electrode cutter is sufficiently robust enough as to make it a spinning blade unnecessary , then the blade may either not be spun up , or the blade rotary mechanism may be omitted , or a non - rotating blade may be used . in many embodiments , it will be useful to allow the location and orientation of the catheter head ( 201 ), nose ( 109 ), and cutting window / wheel region ( 106 / 107 ) to be identified by x - ray fluoroscopy by constructing these regions out of suitable combinations of translucent and radio opaque materials , thus , for example , enabling the region distal to the cutting head to be distinguished from the region proximal to the cutting head . in addition to fluoroscopy localization , other modalities , such as light ( optical ) and sonic ( ultrasonic ) localization methods may also be used . here orientation may be facilitated by running a fiber optic strand through the catheter ( 104 ) ( not shown ) to an appropriate location on the catheter head , and determining the location and orientation of the head by optical means . alternatively an ultrasonic transducer or pickup may be incorporated into the catheter head . typically the flexible outer catheter tube ( 104 ) between the handle ( 101 ) and the head ( 105 ) will have a length between 50 cm and 200 cm , a diameter between 1 french ( 0 . 33 mm ) and 12 french ( 4 mm ), and will usually be between 3 french ( 4 mm ) and 9 french ( 3 mm ) in diameter . the catheter body will often be made from extruded organic polymers such as polyvinylchloride , polyurethane , polyester , polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ), silicon rubber , or similar materials . the catheter body may be reinforced as needed with wires , coils , or filaments as needed to give the body additional strength and to control rigidity and pushabiliy . portions of the catheter head ( 105 ) ( distal region of the catheter ) will often be rigid or partially rigid , and can be made from materials such as metals , hard plastics , composite materials , niti steel ( optionally coated with titanium nitride , tantalum , me - 92 \u00ae or diamonds . usually stainless steel or platinum / iridium will be used . the length of the middle portion of the catheter head may often vary between about 5 to 35 mm ( 201 ), and will usually be between about 10 to 25 mm , however alternative lengths ( longer or shorter ) may also be used . as previously discussed , the extreme distal end of the catheter head ( the nose ) ( 109 ) will usually be made to be both flexible and a traumatic so as to allow the catheter to be threaded through arteries , veins , or other body lumens with maximum ease and minimum trauma . because , in this design , the nose is no longer used to store plaque , this nose design may be optimized to accommodate the distal drive mechanism and also optimized to allow easy passage of the catheter through arteries . in some cases , the distal tip will have an inner coil construction to maximize flexibility . the distance between the rigid part of the catheter head and the distal end tip of the flexible catheter nose will typically be between 10 and 30 mm , but may vary as needs dictate . fig2 b shows the catheter head with the catheter nose cone ( 109 ) in the angled , drooped or bent configuration . typically this nose angle will be adjustable by the operator , either through a cam mechanism ( not shown ) coupled through the catheter tube ( 104 ) to the operator handle ( 101 ), or through selection of materials with appropriate rigidity / elasticity and bendability so that the operator may adjust the nose angle to an appropriate level by pulling or pushing on the catheter handle ( 101 ) and tube ( 104 ). fig2 b shows that in this configuration , nose cone ( 109 ) is bent relative to body ( 201 ). this bending is a simple way to effectively increase the cross sectional area of the catheter , and is used to force the cutting edge of the catheter against the appropriate target zone . in the confines of a narrow body lumen such as an artery , nose cone ( 109 ) is deflected until it contacts a body lumen wall ( i . e . the opposite wall of the artery ). this pushes ( or \u201c urges \u201d) cutting window ( 107 ) and cutter ( 106 ) in the opposite direction . if appropriately directed , this will push , force , or urge the cutter against the appropriate target zone ( usually a region of the artery occluded or partially occluded with plaque ). once the cutter is in proper position , with the correct amount of \u201c force \u201d or \u201c push \u201d dialed in by the angle of the nose deflection , the catheter can then be moved by the operator , shaving away unwanted plaque material . fig3 shows a diagram of the catheter head of the present invention cutting plaque ( 301 ) from an artery wall ( 302 ). in this configuration , the catheter &# 39 ; s nose ( 109 ) has been deflected at enough of an angle to contact the opposite artery wall ( 303 ). the cutting wheel ( 106 ) has been forced up against the plaque ( 301 ) and has already cut away a section of this plaque ( 304 ). a dangling region of plaque ( 305 ) is entering the hollow catheter body ( 206 ) through the window ( 107 ). here , the operator controls the speed and extent of plaque removal by using control ( 101 ) to partially retract the catheter head over the plaque by pulling on catheter tube ( 104 ), while wheel ( 106 ) is spinning and exposed to the plaque through window ( 107 ). excess plaque ( 306 ) is stored in the hollow region of the catheter head ( 206 ). the drawing is not to scale , in actuality ; the available storage space ( 206 ) will typically be substantially larger than the storage space of nosecone ( 109 ). often , it may be advantageous to use a guidewire as a type of monorail to quickly direct catheters to the correct target zones . usually such guidewires will have diameters between about 0 . 010 \u2033 and 0 . 032 \u2033, usually around 0 . 014 \u2033. when this option is desired , the catheter may be designed to be compatible with guidewire use . fig4 shows one possible way in which the catheter of the present invention may work with a guide wire . in this example , guidewire ( 401 ) is threaded up through hollow catheter tube ( 104 ). in order to allow the head &# 39 ; s cutting mechanism to operate freely and without risk of entanglement from a guide wire , it may be useful to have the guide wire exit from the main catheter tube through a first proximal exit port on the head ( 203 ), thus skipping the storage area ( 206 ) window ( 107 ) and plaque cutting ( 106 ) regions of the head . in this configuration , the guide wire would then typically reenter the nose cone ( 109 ) at opening ( 204 ), travel through the nose end of the head for a short distance , and then finally exit the head again through a third exit port or opening ( 205 ), often located near the tip of the catheter &# 39 ; s nose ( 109 ) at the extreme distal end of the catheter in some embodiments , it may also be desirable to protect the portion or portions of the guidewire that is briefly external to the catheter head ( 402 ) by a guidewire tube / lumen or a telescoping guidewire tube / lumen ( 403 ). such guidewire protection lumens may have a length between about 2 and 14 cm , or even longer as needed to accommodate longer heads with higher plaque storage volumes . this telescoping guidewire lumen protects both the guidewire and the patient &# 39 ; s artery linings from inadvertent excessive pressure while the catheter head traverses narrow arteries , and also insures that the guidewire never comes into contact with window ( 107 ) or cutter ( 106 ). in some embodiments , the telescoping guidewire lumen may serve a secondary purpose by also acting as a means to transmit torque ( 212 ) from a rotating shaft in the catheter tube ( 104 ) to the cutting wheel ( 106 ) as previously shown and discussed in fig2 a . this dual - action role ( guidewire protection / torque transmission ) helps to minimize the cross section area of the catheter head when an off - axis drive mechanism is used . in still another embodiment , lumen ( 403 )/ drive shaft ( 212 ) can consist of one or more nested hollow tubes so that an inner tube may rotate and conduct torque to drive wheel ( 106 ), yet the outerpart of the lumen may be substantially stationary as to avoid tangling with a body lumen . the guide wire may still progress through the hollow inner core of this nested structure . many other combinations of drive mechanisms , catheter configurations , and sensor configurations are also possible , and some of these are shown in fig5 a and 5b . as shown in fig5 a , the rotary cutter ( 106 ) does not necessarily have to be coupled to a rotating shaft of any sort from catheter tube ( 104 ). rather , the rotary cutter may be adequately driven from the distal end of the catheter by means of a small electric motor or turbine ( 501 ). this motor or turbine may in turn derive power from catheter tube ( 104 ) and in some embodiments handle ( 101 ) as well by appropriate wires or miniature pressure or chemical tubes ( not shown ) progressing up catheter tube ( 104 ). as shown in fig5 b , in some embodiments , the catheter head ( 105 ) may additionally have various imaging or positional sensors , such as ultrasound transducer arrays , optical fibers , coherence tomography devices , infrared sensors , directional ultrasonic sensors , etc . mounted on the catheter head or nose region ( 502 ), ( 503 ). in one embodiment , the orientation of the sensor or sensors may be directed by the operator to give information as to the status of the plaque and / or artery of or other body lumen that is facing the cutting window of the catheter . this can allow the operator to determine if the catheter is in the proper orientation relative to its intended target . examples of such sensors were described in more detail in application ser . no . 10 / 421 , 980 , the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference . fig5 b also shows yet another embodiment in which the plaque storage container ( 506 ) is extended to now also include some of the hollow core of the catheter tube itself ( 104 ). with this configuration , handle ( 101 ) may be hooked up to a suction or cleaning device , as needed , to give the catheter a near infinite ability to accommodate plaque shavings . with this configuration , the catheter need never be removed from the body until the complete plaque removal task is accomplished ."}

optic tunable filter ( aotf ) 12 that uses radio waves to filter white light into different colors of diffracted light . as illustrated in fig2 , the aotf 12 device is made up of a specially cut birefringent crystal prism on which a thin plate piezoelectric transducer 16 is bonded on one side of the crystal and an acoustic absorber 17 on the opposite facet . when a radio frequency wave is applied to this transducer , it generates an ultrasonic wave which travels through the crystal and gets absorbed at the other end by the acoustic absorber . the traveling sound wave in the crystal acts like a grating and light gets diffracted in an anisotropic diffraction process . as shown in fig1 , the hyperspectral imaging system 10 comprises lenses 11 a , b to collimate the light beam , an acousto - optic tunable filter 12 , a lens 14 and a single color diffracted light camera 15 . although a camera is shown in fig1 , a charge coupled devices ( ccd ) operating as a spatially integrated detector could be used without departing from the spirit of the invention . any array of detectors that covers an area or any detector that scans an area may be used in place of a ccd . although lenses 11 a , 11 b and 14 have been described above , one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the lenses could be omitted and / or replaces by suitable optical devices which provide for the focusing or redirecting of light such as prisms and the like . there are two types of acousto - optic tunable filters ( aotf ): collinear and non collinear . in a non collinear filter , incident and diffracted light and acoustic beams do not travel in the same direction while in a collinear filter all these beams travel in the same direction . as depicted in fig2 , for a white light collimated incident beam that is incident normal to the input facet of a noncollinear aotf filter , in general there are three beams that come out of the crystal , two diffracted beams ( 1 and 2 ) and a zero order beam ( as depicted by beams 303 , 305 and 307 , respectively , in fig3 ). for a white light collimated incident beam that is incident normal to the input facet of a noncollinear filter , in general there are three beams that come out of the crystal . these include two diffracted beams at specific angles with respect to the incident beam with orthogonal polarization at a specific wavelength corresponding to the applied radio frequency and the third beam called the zero - order beam contain all the light except the amount that was diffracted at the particular optical wavelengths . as depicted in fig2 , the two diffracted beams are at specific angles with respect to the incident beam with orthogonal polarization at a specific wavelength corresponding to the applied radio frequency . the zero order beam contains the light remaining after the amount that was diffracted at the particular optical wavelengths . in the case of a collinear filter where there is only one diffracted beam , a polarizer before the filter and an analyzer after the filter are used to separate the incident light and the zero order beam from the diffracted beam . the diffracted optical wavelength is inversely proportional to the applied radio frequency . the wavelength of the diffracted light can be changed by changing the applied radio frequency . acousto - optic tunable filters ( aotf ) using teo 2 crystal are available commercially covering wavelengths from 400 to 800 nm . the advantage of using such filters instead of traditional dispersive elements such as gratings and prism is that they can generate a full two dimensional scene at a specific wavelength at one time without using any motion . also , wavelength can be changed in either a sequential or random manner . another advantage of using such filters is fast speed ; up to 100000 spectral frames per second can be generated . a third advantage is that no moving parts are involved and a robust system can be developed . a fourth advantage is that the frequency change operation can be done remotely . a fifth advantage is that spectral images can be captured only at desired wavelengths instead of generating hundreds of spectral scenes to fill the image cube . other hyperspectral imagers using liquid crystal tunable filter , fabry perot tunable filters , diffractive optical lens and other techniques can also be used . the light source 2 can be a white light source such as a lamp or sunlight . as depicted in fig1 , a preferred embodiment utilizes a fiber - optic coupled light as a source and an acousto optic tunable filter 12 to image different optical colors in the visible wavelength region . the acousto - optic tunable filter may be fabricated in single crystal of tellurium dioxide . two plano - convex lenses 11 a and 11 b are used to form a collimated beam . the spectral scene is imaged on a commercial ccd camera 15 that is connected to a frame grabber to digitize the analog output of the camera . the digitized image is stored on a computer or image processor . the operation of the acousto - optic tunable filter ( aotf ) 12 and camera 15 may be automated . the radio frequency signal applied to the imager is also controlled from the same software as the imager . an aotf imager used in conjunction with the principles of the present invention operates over the visible to near - infrared ( vnir ) region from 400 to 800 nm . it has a 10 nm spectral resolution at 600 nm . each spectral image is acquired with two retardation values from the liquid crystal variable retarder corresponding to the horizontal and vertical incident polarizations of light . the system ( as shown in fig5 ) comprises a tellurium dioxide ( teo 2 ) noncollinear aotf , two irises ( i 1 , i 2 ), two plano - convex lenses l 1 , l 2 , two plane mirrors ( m 1 , m 2 ) mounted on adjustable tilt plates , an electronically tunable liquid crystal variable retarder ( lcvr ) 13 , one camera lens 14 and one ccd camera 15 . an optional computer 30 may be used to control the assembly and for storage of images . as an example , the camera 15 may be a commercial ccd camera such as the watec model 902 with 1 \u2033 camera lens . the applied rf signal is obtained from a computer - controlled rf controller and the lcvr applied voltage is obtained from an lcvr controller which may also be controlled from a computer 30 . as an example , the liquid crystal variable retarder ( lcvr ), used to change incident polarization , can collect both spectral and polarization signatures under computer control and may have a range of 400 - 800 nm , passband 10 nm @ 600 nm , a weight of less than 5 lb , and a size of approximately 8 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 inch . further descriptive material is found in n . gupta , et al ., \u201c acousto - optic tunable filter based visible - to near - infrared spectropolarimetric imager ,\u201d opt . eng . 41 , 1033 - 1038 ( 2002 )), hereby incorporated by reference . the utilized aotf 12 was essentially a real - time programmable solid - state no - moving - parts optical device which performs both filtering and dispersing operations ( see n . gupta , \u201c acousto - optic tunable filters ,\u201d opt . photon . news 8 , 23 - 27 ( 1997 ) and m . s . gottlieb , \u201c design and fabrication of acousto - optic devices ,\u201d chap . 4 in designing and fabrication of acousto - optic devices , a . goutzoulis and d . pape , eds ., pp . 197 - 283 , marcel dekker , new york : ( 1994 )). an aotf is fabricated as a specially cut prism in a single crystal of birefringent material which is transparent in the spectral region of interest and has a low acoustic absorption . the crystal is specially cut based on a wide angle bragg diffraction geometry and both its input and output facets are antireflection coated . the crystal geometry is chosen such that the incident optical beam direction is perpendicular to the input facet . a piezoelectric transducer is bonded on one side of the crystal and an acoustic absorber is applied to the opposite side of the transducer . when a radio frequency ( rf ) signal is applied to the piezoelectric transducer , it converts it into an acoustic shear beam that propagates inside the crystal and sets up regions of high and low densities within the crystal . the propagating acoustic beam is absorbed by the acoustic absorber when it traverses through the crystal . thus a moving phase grating is set up inside the crystal whose period is given by the wavelength of the acoustic wave in the crystal . this grating can be erased by removing the applied rf or the period of the grating is changed by changing the frequency of the applied rf signal . the light source can be a white light source such a lamp or sunlight . when white light is incident on the input facet of the crystal , it passes only a selected narrow band with the center wavelength inversely proportional to the frequency of the applied rf signal based on principle of conservation of momentum . in other words , the crystal acts as a narrow bandpass filter that can be used to pass light with a single wavelength . owing to conservation of energy , the frequency of the diffracted light is doppler shifted , but this frequency shift is insignificant and can be ignored ( the frequency of the incident light is a few million times greater than the frequency of the ultrasonic beam ). such an interaction between light and sound is known as inhomogenous bragg diffraction . the time it takes for the acoustic beam to propagate from the transducer to the absorber is the time it takes to change the passband of the filter . most aotfs used in spectral imaging applications use a noncollinear geometry in designing an aotf cell which uses a wide angle bragg interaction geometry based on the symmetry properties of the anisotropic crystal under consideration . fig3 is a schematic diagram of a preferred embodiment of a hyperspectral scene generation system 10 a comprising a light source , an optic system 204 , a tunable dispersive device 12 ( comprising a noncollinear acousto - optic tunable filter with a transducer 16 and absorber 17 ), a tuning system 21 that controls the tuning of the dispersive device 12 through a transducer 16 , a lens 14 , and a display system 15 . the light source may be a fiber - optic coupled broadband light as a source . as an example , an acoustooptic tunable filter 12 may be utilized to image different optical colors in the visible wavelength region . the acoustooptic tunable filter 12 may be fabricated in single crystal of tellurium dioxide . two plano - convex lenses may be used to form a collimated beam . the spectral scene is imaged on a commercial ccd camera that is connected to a frame grabber to digitize the analog output of the camera . the digitized image may be stored on a computer 30 . the operation of the acousto - optic tunable filter and camera are automated and / or may be controlled by a computer 30 . the radio frequency signal applied to the imager may also be controlled from the same software as the imager , optionally contained on computer 30 . as depicted in fig3 , the imager shown uses one of the diffracted beams and blocks the undiffracted beams . the other diffracted beam may be blocked as well as shown by the dotted block . for aotf tuning , diffracted wavelength \u03bb 0 depends on crystal birefringence , acoustic velocity , angle of light incidence , and applied radio frequency ; related as follows : spectral resolution depends on diffracted wavelength , length of acousto - optic interaction , birefringence , and angle of light incidence , related as follows : optionally , the light source can comprise a two - dimensional broadband light source , which covers the electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet ( uv ) to infrared ( ir ). in some embodiments , a light source can be used where only a portion of the uv to ir range is covered or a different electromagnetic range is covered . the light source 202 can be a white light source . other configurations for the light source 202 can be used , including a 2 - d resistor array of elements , where each element can be heated under individual control to emit infrared light , a micro - mirror device with a 2 - d structure , where each mirror can be controlled separately , or light emitting diodes . regardless of the light source embodiment used , each of the light sources may be operated with or without computer control . for example , if you utilize three light sources having wavelengths of approximately 540 , 560 and roughly 580 ( 577 nm ), the illumination could be accomplished to compare returns and analyze the subject as to whether the subject is oxygenated or deoxygenated . the optic system 204 may comprise one or more filters and lenses . the optic system 204 receives the light from the light source 202 , and in one embodiment , collimates the received light . the collimated beam of light is filtered and provided to the dispersive device 12 . in some embodiments , non - collimated beams may be generated and processed . the dispersive device 12 is coupled to the tuning system 214 through a transducer 16 . the transducer 216 may be , for example , a thin plate piezoelectric transducer . the tuning system 214 provides an adjustable radio frequency ( rf ) signal to the transducer 216 , which converts the signal to sound waves . the sound waves cause dispersion of the collimated beam provided by the optic system 204 , resulting in the production of beams of light at distinct wavelengths . the tuning system 21 may comprise a computer or other processing device , control software , and / or an rf generator . through application of an adjustable rf signal to the transducer 16 coupled to the dispersive device 12 , the wavelength of the spectral image of the scene generated on the display system 15 can be changed . in other words , all the radio frequency change operations can be done seamlessly under computer control , locally or from a remote location . in some embodiments , manual adjustment can be used in addition to or in lieu of automatic control . further , in response to either manual input or in response to instructions from control software , the tuning system 14 can provide sequential changes or random changes ( or a combination of both ) to the frequency signal . in one embodiment , the dispersive device 12 comprises a non - collinear , acousto - optic tunable spectral filter . the dispersive device 12 may also comprise an aperture , among other elements . other dispersive devices that are tunable and produce regions of high and low density ( e . g ., compression and rarefaction ) to produce a grating ( e . g ., phase grating ) effect based on the tuning signal can be used to obtain images of full 2 - d spectral scenes , including liquid crystal light filters , fabry - perot interferometers , michaelson interferometers , or diffractive optical lenses , among other devices . the light output from the dispersive device 12 at a distinct wavelength passes through the lens 14 ( e . g ., an iris lens ) and is imaged onto and / or in the display system 15 . the display system 15 may comprise a projection screen , video monitor , computer , and / or a 2 - d detector array ( e . g ., as provided in a camera ). for example , the display system 15 may comprise a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera and a computer . the ccd camera may be coupled to a frame grabber to digitize the analog output of the camera , and the digitized images can be stored on a computer . the operation of the dispersive device 12 and / or display system 15 may be manually operated or automated , or a combination of both forms of control . it will be understood that the hyperspectral scene generation system 10 a illustrated in fig3 provides an overview of an exemplary embodiment of a hyperspectral scene projection / generation system 10 a , and in some embodiments may include fewer , greater , and / or different components . in the preferred embodiment depicted in fig5 , a compact , portable , agile spectropolarimetric vnir imager was used with an aotf 12 for the light dispersive element in combination with lcvr 13 for polarization selection and a ccd camera to cover the spectral range of operation . the imager was used to carry out some passive imaging experiments using a human subject to evaluate the imaging capabilities in detecting oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood by constricting the blood flow \u2014( i ) in a finger by wrapping a tight rubber band around the finger and ( ii ) in the lower arm by using a pressure cuff on the upper arm . the subject was located approximately two meters away from the imager . after collecting an image cube and analyzing it using hyperspectral image processing software , the effects of skin deoxygenation was observed both in the constricted finger and the arm . the imager was used in a passive mode from 400 to 800 nm with a 10 - nm interval to acquire spectral images at 41 bands with polarization settings of 0 \u00b0 and 90 \u00b0 at each wavelength corresponding to the horizontal and the vertical polarizations of the reflected light from a human hand and arm illuminated by an ordinary white light source . although 41 bands were selected , any number of bands could be utilized depending upon the circumstances and accuracy desired . the hand and arm were located two meters from the camera . two separate experiments were performed : first for imaging the hand with the index finger constricted by a rubber band wrapped around it and the second for imaging the lower arm when the upper arm was constricted by a pressure cuff . the spectral analysis was performed using envi ( registered trademark ), but one of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that other procedures could be utilized with comparable results . for each imaged object two separate image cubes each with 41 bands were obtained corresponding to the two orthogonal polarizations of the light reflected from the illuminated object . a diffuse white board was also imaged and was used to normalize the data . the spectral plots clearly showed the two peaks corresponding to the oxygenated skin for the unconstructed finger due to oxyhemoglobin ( corresponding to 540 and 577 nm ) and the single peak due to deoxyhemoglobin ( corresponding to 559 nm ) for the constricted index finger and the lower arm . an ordinary white light source was used to illuminate the objects and the images were collected from a distance of two meters with no prior sample preparation ; the results showed the effect of oxygenation and deoxygenation for a live human subject . higher image contrast can be achieved by using both spectral and polarization signatures . spectral features arise due to the material properties of objects , as a result of the emission , reflection , and absorption of light . the polarization features arise from the physical nature of the object including surface roughness and subsurface scattering . using a hyperspectral imager , one can acquire an image cube that consists of a number of spectral images of the same scene taken at a number of narrow spectral bands . spectral signatures from each pixel can be easily extracted and used to obtain the characteristic spectral signatures of different materials that make up objects and backgrounds in the scene or subject of interest . fig2 and 3 show the propagation of light and sound waves in a noncollinear aotf cell . the filter design is based on the consideration that for a spectral imaging instrument and a fairly broad bandpass is needed and a large linear as well as angular aperture such that there is a substantial light throughput . in fig2 , the filtering operation of a noncollinear aotf is shown with the transducer and absorber . when unpolarized white light is incident on the input facet , it gets diffracted by the traveling grating set up in the crystal by the acoustic wave . the two orthogonally polarized diffracted light beams 1 and 2 at a wavelength inversely proportional to the applied rf , are coming out at an angle to the incident beam . the zero order beams contain all wavelengths except the one that was diffracted by the traveling grating . the period of the traveling grating is given by the wavelength of the acoustic wave in the crystal and can be changed by changing the applied rf . only one of the diffracted beams is used for imaging by blocking the rest of the beams . an aotf imager designed in accordance with the principles of the present invention uses the concept that for an unpolarized incident light , a noncollinear aotf has two diffracted beams , along with two orthogonally polarized undiffracted beams that contain all the incident wavelengths minus the one that is diffracted . the advantages of an aotf include light weight , compact , electronic tuning , lack of moving parts , low drive power , rapid tuning and scanning ( 100 , 000 frames / sec ), high spectral resolution , broad tuning range , rf - driven and remote control operation ; sequential or random or multi wavelength access ; and polarization separation . a preferred embodiment imager design uses one of the diffracted beams and blocks the other diffracted beam as well as the undiffracted beams as shown in fig2 . diffracted wavelength depends on crystal birefringence , acoustic velocity , angle of light incidence , and applied radio frequency : the tuning relationship and the spectral resolution for a noncollinear filter , using wide - angle diffraction geometry , can be approximated by the following two equations . in the first equation , diffracted wavelength depends on crystal birefringence , acoustic velocity , angle of light incidence , and applied radio frequency . in the second equation , spectral resolution depends on diffracted wavelength , length of acousto - optic interaction , birefringence , and angle of light incidence . \u03bb 0 = \u03b4 \u2062 \u2062 nv f a \u2061 [ sin 2 \u2062 2 \u2062 \u03b8 i + sin 4 \u2062 \u03b8 i ] 1 / 2 ( 1 ) \u03b4 \u2062 \u2062 \u03bb \u03bb 0 = 0 . 9 \u2062 \u03bb 0 l \u2062 \u2062 \u03b4 \u2062 \u2062 n \u2062 \u2062 sin 2 \u2062 \u03b8 i \u2261 1 r ( 2 ) where \u03bb 0 is the diffracted optical wavelength , \u03b4n is the birefringence of the material ( difference of two refractive indices ), v is the acoustic velocity in the material , fa is the applied rf signal ( same as the acoustic frequency ), \u03b8 1 is the optical angle of incidence with respect to the crystal optic axis , l is the length of ao interaction in the crystal ( same as the length of the transducer ), \u03b4\u03bb is the optical passband , and r is the spectral resolution . it is clear from eq . ( 1 ) that the optical wavelength can be changed by changing applied rf because \u03bb 0 increases as fa decreases or vice versa . to obtain polarization information , as shown in fig5 , a spectrally tunable commercial lcvr 13 is placed in front of the aotf , and uses two retardance values corresponding to the horizontal and vertical polarizations for each diffracted wavelength . the tuning of such a retarder is done by changing the applied voltage . an lcvr is a device that is made of a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal between two parallel glass windows spaced a few microns apart . the retardance or the phase shift between the two orthogonally linearly polarized components of transmitted light by lcvr is obtained by applying a low voltage waveform to the liquid crystal layer . see , \u201c stokes polarimetry using liquid crystal variable retarders ,\u201d meadowlark optics , inc .

1 . 8 mm . variable retardance can be obtained by varying the applied voltage . a graph of the retardance as a function of voltage is shown in fig8 . for each wavelength , two different values of voltage are used corresponding to zero and quarter wave retardances to obtain images with two orthogonal polarizations . the values of these two retardances vary as a function of wavelength and corresponding plots can be obtained from the vendor . a preferred embodiment atof assembly may optionally comprise a small black box mounted on a tripod as depicted in fig9 . as depicted in fig5 , the light from the scene is first incident on the first iris which defines the angular aperture of the aotf . next , the light passes through an lcvr where a retardance is applied to it as discussed above . the light transmitted from the lcvr is next imaged inside the aotf cell by the first plano convex lens and after the aotf only one of the two diffracted beams from the aotf is imaged on the ccd camera using the combination of the second plano convex lens , second iris 12 and the camera lens . the two plane mirrors m 1 and m 2 are mounted on the tilt plates that are used to fold the optical path in order for the optical package to fit inside a small box . by tuning the filtered wavelength over the entire tuning range , two separate hyperspectral image cubes can be acquired corresponding to the two orthogonal polarizations . since both the retarder and the aotf are tuned electronically , no moving parts are involved , and the imager is adaptive and robust as compared to other traditional hyperspectral imagers . the applied radio frequency ( rf ) signal for the lcvr is obtained from a computer - controlled rf controller and the lcvr applied voltage is obtained from an lcvr controller which is also controlled from a computer . the specifications of the acousto optic filter ( aotf ) imager are given in table 1 below . the present invention may be utilized to find out if a person &# 39 ; s blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated by using remotely captured hyperspectral images of a person &# 39 ; s arm or other body parts by using an acousto - optic based hyperspectral imager operating from 400 to 800 nm . the light from a fiber optic coupled source is illuminated on a person &# 39 ; s body part and then spectral images are captured using an automated hyperspectral imager . in order to recreate a deoxygenated arm , the arm or the other body part is put under pressure to reduce the oxygen level in the blood and spectral images are captured . a diffuse white board sitting at the same position as the arm or other body part is then imaged with same illumination . hyperspectral image cubes were generated using a commercial hyperspectral software package and spectrum of a point on the arm was extracted and normalized using the spectrum from the white board . this effectively cancels out the spectral response of the light source and the imager . when the spectrum from the arm under pressure are examined , it clearly shows that the blood is deoxygenated while similar data from the arm under normal condition shows that the blood is oxygenated . the same or similar procedure could be useful in a hostile or battlefield scenario to remotely determine if an individual is alive or dead without touching his or her body to determine his pulse . this would avoid others from exposure to chemical and biological agents if the person in question was exposed to them in a hostile environment . experiments were conducted to assess the ability of a preferred embodiment spectropolarimetric imager with respect to measurement of oxygen saturation ( so 2 ) in the skin . two spectral imaging experiments were carried out to obtain image cubes using a vnir imager to image ( i ) a hand and ( ii ) arm of a human subject located two meters away from the imager . also recorded were image cubes of a diffuse white board to normalize the images obtained from the hand and arm . in a first experiment an ordinary white light lamp source was used to illuminate the hand of a volunteer . passively imaged diffuse reflection from live human subject skin was conducted at a range of 2 meters using ordinary unpolarized white light source . in the first experiment , a rubber band was tied on the index finger of the individual to interrupt the flow of oxygenated blood to that area . in the second experiment with the arm , a pressure cuff was applied to the upper arm of the subject that was also illuminated by the same white light source as in the first experiment and the forearm and hand were imaged . images were recorded from 400 nm to 800 nm with a 10 nm spectral interval . images were acquired before and after \u02dc 5 minute blood constriction . two separate image cubes each with 41 spectral images corresponding to two orthogonal polarizations were recorded for each object . the wavelength was changed by varying the applied rf between 50 and 120 mhz to correspond to the desired optical wavelength range . the rf signal power used was less than 1 . 0 w . each spectral image was recorded with two orthogonal polarizations of the light incident on the imager . both the rf synthesizer and the lcvr were controlled using a personal computer . the ccd output was captured and digitized using a frame grabber and stored on the computer hard drive . the size of each stored image was 640 \u00d7 480 pixels . a custom designed graphical user interface was used for a seamless operation of the imager . some examples of the spectropolarimetric images obtained with an imager constructed with the principles of the present invention and used in the experiment are presented . fig1 illustrates how images of a hand and arm can be collected with rubber band on the index finger were collected . shown in fig1 are three spectral images collected with horizontal polarization . the top of fig1 shows three examples of reflected spectral images ( taken using light having wavelengths of approximately 540 nm , 560 nm and 580 nm ) of a human hand ( collected with rubber band on the index finger ) and the bottom shows similar images ( taken using light having wavelengths of approximately 540 nm , 560 nm and 580 nm ) for lower arm collected with horizontal polarization . the wavelength dependence of the skin reflectance may be analyzed using a computer program such as envi ( trademark ). two regions of interest ( 30 \u00d7 30 pixels each ) were selected on a constricted finger and on an un - constricted finger . absorbance in each location was calculated after normalizing the skin values by our reflectance standard ( white board ) using eq 3 . typical results for the finger experiment are illustrated in fig1 . the absorbance spectrum on the unconstructed finger is typical of oxygenated hemoglobin with two visible peaks at 540 nm and 577 nm . for the constricted finger these peaks have disappeared and are replaced by a large peak centered around 559 nm . fig1 through 16 are graphical illustration of the mean of regions of interest captured on a constricted finger and on an unconstricted finger ( circles ). the data was normalized by the respective 420 nm value for both curves . oxygen saturation in both regions of interest was calculated using an algorithm first proposed by n . kollias , a h baqer , \u201c quantitative assessment of uv - induced pigmentation and erythema ,\u201d photodermatol . 1988 ; 5 , pp . 53 - 60 , ( hereby incorporated by reference ) which takes into account the effect of melanin absorption by subtracting its contribution from the general data skin pigmentation is approximated as the slope of a fitted straight line between the values of absorbance at 620 nm and 720 nm , the absorbance curve of melanin decreasing monotonically between 600 and 750 nm . oxygen saturation is calculated by using tabulated absorption curves of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to fit the experimental data in the range 550 to 580 nm . oxygen saturation in the un - constricted finger was close to 60 % while in the constricted finger values around 1 % were obtained . these values agree with the one obtained by other groups with different experimental techniques and algorithms as discussed in n . kollias , a h baqer , \u201c quantitative assessment of uv - induced pigmentation and erythema ,\u201d photodermatol . 1988 ; 5 , pp . 53 - 60 , and m . p . siegel , y . l . kim , h . k . roy , r . k . wali , v . backman , \u201c assessment of blood supply in superficial tissue by polarization - gated eleastic light - scattering spectroscopy ,\u201d 45 , appl . optics , 2006 , both of which are hereby incorporated by reference . skin oxygen saturation is expected to vary between 50 % and 70 % due to the spatial micro non - uniformity of so 2 ( oxygen saturation ) in the skin layers . values collected on the forearm yielded similar results , so 2 was \u02dc 50 % before the pressure cuff was put in place and plummeted to 0 % after a few minutes of vasoconstriction . since the light source was unpolarized , no polarization gating was obtained from the reflected images . a compact , portable , agile spectropolarimetric vnir imager was used with an aotf for the light dispersive element in combination with lcvr for polarization selection and a ccd camera to cover the spectral range of operation . this imager was used in a passive mode from 400 to 800 nm with a 10 - nm interval to acquire spectral images at 41 bands with polarization settings of 0 \u00b0 and 90 \u00b0 at each wavelength corresponding to the horizontal and the vertical polarizations of the reflected light from a human hand and arm illuminated by an ordinary white light source . the hand and arm were located two meters from the camera . however , other distances could be utilized without departing from the spirit of the invention . two separate experiments were performed : first for imaging the hand with the index finger constricted by a rubber band wrapped around it and the second for imaging the lower arm when the upper arm was constricted by a pressure cuff . the spectral analysis was performed using matlab . for each imaged object two separate image cubes each with 41 bands were obtained corresponding to the two orthogonal polarizations of the light reflected from the illuminated object . a diffuse white board was also imaged and was used to normalize the data . the spectral plots clearly showed the two peaks corresponding to the oxygenated skin for the unconstructed finger due to oxyhemoglobin ( corresponding to 540 and 577 nm ) and the single peak due to deoxyhemoglobin ( corresponding to 559 nm ) for the constricted index finger and the lower arm . considering that an ordinary white light source was used to illuminate the objects and the images were collected from a distance of two meter with no prior sample preparation , these results are rather remarkable in showing the effect of oxygenation and deoxygenation for a live human subject . further work may provide enhanced sensitivity . based on the results , it should be noted that a prototype aotf - based imager which was developed for military applications provides a useful tool for data acquisition for biomedical applications in either hyperspectral or spectropolarimetric modes because such imagers are compact and agile with no - moving parts and have automated operation and are easy to use . fig1 illustrates image acquisition and analysis using a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprising the steps of collecting spectral images at same polarization , form an image cube using the spectral images ; extract a spectral profile across the cube , and obtaining normalized absorbance wrt reference . as shown at the bottom right of fig1 , oxygenated blood contained a \u201c valley \u201d in the graphical representation which correlates to the absorption by oxygen in the blood at the given wavelength . experiments were conducted and video / photographs taken to produce spectral images in each image cube from 800 to 400 nm of constricted human body components ; the left image being a hand with a constricted finger and the right image being a constricted arm with a pressure cuff . for example , a video of 41 sequential frames could be used to produce an image \u201c cube \u201d with 41 frames , as schematically shown in fig1 . fig1 depicts skin analysis conducted in accordance with the principles of the present invention . as seen in the graph in fig1 , the unconstricted finger gives typical two visible peaks at 540 nm and 577 nm corresponding to oxygenated hemoglobin . the constricted finger has a large peak centered around 559 nm corresponding to deoxyhemoglobin . similar results were obtained for constricted arm . oxygen saturation in the unconstricted finger was close to 60 % and 1 % for the constricted finger using kollias algorithm , similar results obtained for arm . no polarization gating was observed due to the use of unpolarized light . as seen in fig1 , the procedure entailed the steps of extracting the spectral profiles , computing equation 3 ( also shown in fig1 ): a = - log 10 \u2061 ( r skin r board ) fig1 is a graphical presentation illustrating a normalized spectral absorbance showing a comparison of constricted / restricted and nonconstricted / unrestricted finger skin with the absorbance spectrum for an unconstricted finger typical of oxygenated hemoglobin having 2 visible peaks at 540 nm and 577 nm . for a constricted finger these peaks disappear , and a single large peak centered @ 559 nm for deoxyhemoglobin appears . fig1 is a graphical illustration representing spectra ( with horizontal polarization ) obtained from image cubes in which absorbance is plotted as a function of wavelength of light in nanometers . the portion indicative of oxygenated blood is circled . the data shown was not normalized with absorbance value at 420 nm . fig1 is a graphical illustration representing deoxygenated blood ( obtained using a rubber banded index finger ) with a spectral plot obtained from image cubes in which absorbance is plotted as a function of wavelength of light in nanometers ( with horizontal polarization ). the data is not normalized with absorbance value at 420 nm . fig1 is a graphical illustration representing deoxygenated blood ( obtained using a lower arm ) with a spectral plot obtained from image cubes in which absorbance is plotted as a function of wavelength of light in nanometers ( with horizontal polarization ). the data is not normalized with absorbance value at 420 nm . although the preferred embodiments were discussed in relation to determining oxygen content , other chemicals could be detected using the principles of the present invention . for example , for oxygen satuaration ( so 2 ) measurement , using the algorithm described in kollias et al ., the effect of melanin can be \u201c subtracted \u201d by fitting the curve is between 620 - 720 nm . the so 2 may then be calculated by fitting a curve between 550 and 580 nm . the so 2 value obtained for unconstricted finger was a 60 % so 2 value , while for constricted finger the value was 1 %. similar comparison values can be obtained using the forearm . as stated in the foregoing , the present invention is directed to the detection of elements and / or chemicals such as an oxygen deficiency in the blood or hypoxia in a subject body . causative factors such as drowning , strangling , choking , suffocation , cardiac arrest , head trauma , and carbon monoxide poisoning can create conditions leading to cerebral hypoxia , which can lead to coma , seizures , and even brain death . similarly , carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning may lead to histotoxic hypoxia , which is the inability of body tissues to use oxygen . also , certain narcotics will prevent oxygen use by the tissues . the present invention may be used to monitor , screen , or detect the lack of the presence of oxygen in body tissue of subject individuals which may be indicative of poisoning , chemicals , or certain narcotic usage . for a more detailed example of screening systems , see u . s . pat . no . 7 , 141 , 786 , hereby incorporated by reference . moreover , the invention is particularly suitable for persons or subjects with injuries , such as gangrene , whether the individual would be subjected to a great deal of pain if subjected to contemporary diagnostic instruments . since the present invention may be operated at a distance from the subject &# 39 ; s skin , no pain would be encountered . the invention may prove useful in the analysis of bruises on the body which are otherwise not visible which appear when comparing spectral images taken at two orthogonal polarizations . for example , such analysis could prove useful when a coroner wants to asses whether or not a baby has been badly bruised . such bruises may become evident only when the subject is imaged by a modified form of the invention utilizing light . the polarization difference image would provide the shape of the bruise for discernment as to the cause of the bruise . in addition , the present invention could prove useful in the cosmetic industry for the analysis of make - up products ; particularly in conjunction with a polarization varying embodiment of the present invention . for example , using polarized light , light which is reflected from the surface contains information about the different contours ; i . e . bruises . in analyzing the effectiveness of make - up cosmetics , spectral and polarization may also enhance the effectiveness of the analysis of the cosmetic products . it should be emphasized that the above - described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations . many variations and modifications may be made to the above -

20 j / cm 2 , more preferably less than 10 j / cm 2 , more preferably yet less than about 3 j / cm 2 and most preferably less than 1 . 5 j / cm 2 . on the other hand , devices are contemplated that will be used for treatment of skin , and especially devices that can emit energies sufficient to cause damage to a retina of an eye . this includes , for example , laser hair removal treatment , laser skin rejuvenation , laser removal of tattoos , light treatment for acne , light treatment for hair reduction , laser or light treatment for removal of vascular lesions , and heat treatment for acne . the member can have any desired size or shape , provided that the member can still serve as a interrupter not allowing the device to emit energy unless the member has been modified by the location targeted for treatment in a way that would cause discomfort to injury - prone locations such as , for example , eye , injured skin , injured tissue , or pain - sensitive parts of the body . for robustness , the member preferably has a length of no greater than 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , or 10 mm , depending in part upon the type of material , cross - section . there can be multiple members , which can operate independently from one another , or mechanically coupled in some way , for example by being coupled to a common foot . for example , the entire treatment window through which the energy pass to the target can serve as a member where the window , for example , has to be mechanically disturbed or pressed before energy can be emitted . alternatively multiple independent members can operate independently . this mode of operation is useful in making it difficult for an inexperienced user ( for example a child ) to press all multiple members at the same time . if the device is designed so that energy is emitted only if all members position has to be modified simultaneously ( for example , all members has to pushed in by at least 2 mm ) then only a flat surface such as a target surface appropriate for treatment can cause such activation . the eye would be too sensitive to the touch . a child trying to push the multiple members with his fingers would find it difficult to coordinate such a multiple push without also at least partially blocking the beam . the circuit preferably precludes the emitter from emitting the energy unless the first member is depressed . the amount of depression can be less then 5 mm and preferably less than 3 . 5 mm and most preferably less than 2 mm . an aiming beam is also contemplated , preferably one having a lower energy density , and / or a different wavelength from the main emitted energy . said aiming beam can be on when the device is turn on and operate independently of the member that control the activation of the main beam because the aiming beam energy is substantially less powerful than the treatment energy that is designed to operate at power level sufficient for surgical or therapeutic purposes or at power levels designed to achieve tissue modifications or cosmetic improvements . the invention also contemplates a second member so that the device control circuit also couples activity of the emitter with movement of a second member . the characteristics of the second member can be similar to that of the first member described above . the invention also contemplates the possibility of the first and second members are coupled to a common foot . if both members are coupled to the common foot a better stability of operation may be obtained . 13 . the device of claim 1 , wherein the first member includes an expanded portion that absorbs at least 30 % of the first energy . the invention also contemplates the device discussed above with the first member being cooled to protect the surface of the treatment target , for example the surface of the skin . if the surface of the skin is subject to high treatment energy , the first member may be cooled so that when it is in contact with the skin it keep it cooled . for example , the surface of the skin may be cooled below 10 degrees c ., and preferably below 5 degrees c . and most preferably below 3 degrees c . in this embodiment the cooling element can be any cooled component capable of serving as a first member as described above but also cooled to so that upon contact with the skin it will absorb some of the skin temperature . for example , said first member can be passively cooled in a refrigerator or a freezer and brought to the desired temperature so it can bring the surface of the skin down to the temperatures described above . alternatively and preferably , said first member can also be actively cooled . the invention also contemplates using the first member of the device discussed above to incorporate an active cooling element capable of cooling the skin upon contact . in this embodiment , the cooling element can , for example , be made of similar material to those used in thermoelectric coolers ( tec ) and incorporated into the first member . the cooling element can , for example , be made of tec so it also serves the function of the first member as described above . the cooling element can further comprise active cooling element that actively cools the first member for example , a circulating coolant such as freon - like gases can be used to circulate inside said member to actively cool first member . the invention further contemplates incorporating the member of the device as a cooling element that has sufficient cooling capacity such that when the energy is applied at an energy density of at least 15 j / cm 2 to a skin having an epidermal - dermal junction , the junction remains below 50 degrees c . the invention further contemplates that that when the energy is applied at an energy density of at least 10 j / cm 2 , and more preferably at an energy density of at least 5 j / cm 2 and most preferably at an energy density of at least 1 . 5 j / cm 2 to a skin having an epidermal - dermal junction , the junction remains below 50 degrees c . the invention further contemplate that the cooling element is activated at a predetermined time subsequent to a detected movement of the first member . the amount of movement and required force on the member should be similar or greater to that required to activate the energy source . thus , preferably , an activation of the energy source , also activates the cooling element . most preferably , the movement of the first member as described above , should activate the cooling element prior to the activation of the energy source and the emission of energy . for example , the activation of the cooling element subsequent to the detection of movement of the first member should precede the activation of the energy source by about 1 second , and more preferably by about 0 . 2 seconds and more preferably yet by about 0 . 1 second and most preferably by about 0 . 05 second . the invention further contemplates that the first member includes a fluid path through which a fluid is dispensed . for example , the foot of the first member can be hollow and contain , for example , a therapeutic fluid such as benzyl peroxide for the treatment of acne . alternatively and also preferably , the fluid may be , for example , antibiotic for reduction of bacteria , or ala compound to be followed up by a light dosage for a photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) treatment . most preferably the fluid can , for example , contain vitamin and minerals , or nutrient to nourish the skin or hydrate the skin . the fluid path within the member can be designed , for example , to include a series of perforation at the foot of said first member , said perforations are blocked by , for example , a membrane or a thin film that can be actively coupled to the device circuit so that the membrane or thin film are removed and allow flow of the fluid through the perforations and onto the skin surface upon detection of the movement of the first membrane . preferably the invention also contemplates that the first membrane that include a fluid path through which fluid can be dispensed includes a foot , wherein the surface of the foot of the first membrane is rough or contain shaper edges , for example edges that protrude beyond said foot surface from about 0 . 01 mm to 0 . 6 mm . such a design will allow the foot to remove some of the skin upper layers as it contacts and moved across the skin surface , thus enhancing the delivery of the fluid contained within the first member or within the device across the surface of the skin and into the skin . in a preferred embodiment the invention further contemplates that the first member includes a resistive heating element that allow heating of the surface of the skin . the resistive heating element may include a resistor capable of heating the surface of the skin to less than about 400 degrees centigrade , and preferably to less than about 300 degrees centigrade and more 200 degree centigrade , and more preferably yet to 150 degrees centigrade and most preferably to less than about 75 degrees centigrade . preferably , the resistive heating element within the first member heat surface for a time duration of about 3 minutes , more preferably to a time duration of about 2 minutes , more preferably yet for a time duration of about 1 minutes , alternatively and also preferably for a time duration of about 1 minute or less , more preferably yet to a time duration of about 200 ms , and most preferably to a time duration of about 20 ms or less . preferably , the resistive heating element within the first member also include an insulating layer distal to the heating element . said insulating layer may be composed of teflon or polycarbonate or other suitable insulating element . alternatively and preferably said insulating layer may also be transparent to the device energy , for example , made of polycarbonate , glass , or clear plastic . alternatively and preferably , the insulating layer may be transparent to the device energy , electrically insulating but allow some heat conduction for example , made of sapphire . from a method perspective the invention contemplate a method for treatment of skin ailment wherein energy is applied to a targeted surface but said energy is allowed to interact with the surface only if a step of disturbing a member actively coupled to the circuit that triggers the emission of the energy , takes place first . in this preferred embodiment takes the following steps : aiming the energy generating source at the target area . bring the energy generating source to the vicinity of the target area , allow a first member probe to interact with the target area , the interaction step then generate a feedback signal to the energy source that at a pretty determine level , for example , if the first member experience a force sufficient to , upon contact , cause discomfort to a human eye or injured area of the target skin , allow the final step of energy emission direct to the target area on the skin to take place . in yet another preferred embodiment , the device the first member also prevent the device from contacting the targeted material . alternatively and preferably said first member prevents the device from coming into a direct contact with the skin . this is important to avoid overheating of the skin if the window or lens allowing the energy to emerge from the device and into the targeted skin tissue become over heated as it is used to treat the skin ailment . thus even without being cooled , possible heated device transfer of thermal energy is minimized due to first member preventing the device from coming into a direct contact with the skin . the present invention also comprise a device that can be operatively coupled to any existing or contemplated medical or home use treatment device to prevent exposure of eyes or other sensitive skin or tissue to any form of dangerous or unsafe mechanical energy , for example , first member can be inserted in the mechanical energy carrier path , for example a needle , vacuum suction , dermabrasion , microdermabrasion , or a blunt mechanical energy carrier , to prevent activation of said mechanical energy carrier unless first member is moved to a predetermined level . thus first member may for example , be actively coupled to mechanical energy carrier so it is not activated unless the first member is depressed by less then 5 mm with a force that is sufficient to cause discomfort to the eye or injured tissue . alternatively and preferably , said first member may have to be pressed by less than 2 mm and most preferably less than 1 mm . in yet further elaboration of this preferred embodiment , first member may be coupled to a foot . the foot is designed to contact the targeted skin . when the device is pressed again the targeted skin as described above , the emitted energy or mechanical energy carrier ( for example a needle ) is activated and pass through an opening in the foot to impact the skin . the pressure of said first member and the foot it is couple too is sufficient to reduce the amount of pain caused by said energy or mechanical energy carrier ( for example a needle ) as it impact the skin or target tissue . for example , the pressure the first member and the foot it is couple to preferably exert a pressure on the skin that is sufficient from stopping blood flow to the skin in order for said energy source to be activated . in a further preferred embodiment of the present invention the circuit precluded the emitter from emitting the energy unless the first member is depressed by a force sufficient to reduce blood circulation in the skin above the mid - reticular dermis . in an additional preferred embodiment of the present invention , the device include an energy carrier for example a needle and the circuit in the device preclude the needle from moving toward the skin unless first member is depressed by a force sufficient to reduce blood circulation in the skin above the mid - reticular dermis . in an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention , the present invention comprises systems , devices and methods in which a device has an emitter that emits a first energy along a path , a member that extends at least partially into the path and a mechanical coupler that couples activity of the emitter with movement of the first member in a preferred embodiment the circuit or mechanical coupler precluded the emitter from emitting the energy unless the first member is depressed by a force sufficient to reduce the sensation of pain . additionally and preferably , a method for treating tissue with energy is described , the method comprises : directing the output of an energy emitter towards a tissue ; extending a first member at least partially into the path the energy would follow between the energy source output and the target ; coupling the activity of the energy with the movement of the first member . the device described herein utilize light energy , heat energy , or a combination of the two for selective surface heating that allows the user to achieve temporary pore enlargements for cleaning of the skin pores and expulsion of unwanted debris and undesired substance filling the pores , thus reducing the size of unseemly pores and enhancing the health and appearance of the skin . the method also contemplates thermal energy and light energy deposition into the skin to allow selective injury to the upper layers of the skin and new more elastic collagen production . the devise described herein is also designed to allow treatment of the skin more effective with possibly with lower doses of rejuvenating agents . the controlled damage to the epidermis and upper layers of the dermis , that result in new collagen production , and \u201c top and bottom \u201d action via the use of a combined optothermal action through enhanced absorption due to a heating element at the top or action of an absorbing substance at the top and optothermal light to thermal energy conversion throughout the target skin volume . the present invention describes a safety device that can be attached to any laser , light or energy based therapeutic device . it can also be attached to any energy emitting diagnostic or imaging devices if the emitted energy pauses danger to the eyes or to sensitive tissue or skin on a human or animal body that can be damaged . the invention described herein can also be attached to any mechanical or thermal or other medical device that can , upon contact with the eye or sensitive tissue pose danger or cause damage to said eye or sensitive tissue or skin area . a compact hand held device that can be safely used by adolescents and adults wishing to improve the texture and appearance of their skin and to minimize the appearance of acne , blemished skin , or fine wrinkles . it is an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for treating skin conditions , reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles , and clearing skin from blemishes and pigmented spots . another object of the invention is the reduction , management and control of hair on the surface of the skin . another object of the present invention is to provide a hand held device that can be used safely to treat with light or heat or both a controlled amount of tissue and in particular to achieve one or more of the following : skin tissue to allow skin rejuvenation , hair removal , hair reduction , hair management , fine line reduction , collagen regeneration without collateral damage or excess damage adjacent tissue while enhancing skin condition and appearance . in one embodiment , the present invention comprises a hand held device with an on / off switch and a button that allow the device to emit pulsed energy to treat the tissue in contact with the device . in this embodiment , to ensure that the device is activated only when it is in contact with the skin , one or more protruding guards ( pg ) extends in front of the treatment head and allow activation of the device only when all the pg are fully pressed to a predetermined level . this feature is specifically designed to ensure that the device is not activated when placed in front of the eye or other sensitive skin or tissue locations . for example if the device is placed in front of the eye , the protruding plastic or metal guards ( or any other material from which we make the pg ) will cause the eye to close instinctively . the idea is that the pressure or contact in particular mechanical contact of a rigid physical object with the eye or sore or damaged skin or tissue , would cause a sensation of pain or discomfort , would cause the treated person to jerk away or remove or object to the contact . if the device can be activated only after a firm contact and mechanical pressure has been established between the device &# 39 ; s pgs and the target tissue , the patient or person subject to the intended treatment would not willfully or unconsciously allow the device to be activated and the treatment to proceed , thus the treatment subject or patient will not allow damage to such sensitive target area to occur . obviously the aim of the device is to treat the skin not the eye . but if one is not wise enough to avoid aiming the device into the eyes , the device will not fire and not emit its energy ( thermal or optical , or otherwise ) unless it is in close contact against the skin and the pg pushing against it . obviously sensitive locations like the eye will instinctively close to avoid the touch . also areas with skin burns or skin ailment will become uncomfortable under contact with the pg , and one will not want to push the pg against these skin locations , and certainly not push very hard at these locations , thus not allowing the activation of the device . when it is placed on a healthy tissue , the plurality of pgs are pressed in and the device is allowed to fire . a battery within the device powers a circuit board and drives a short pulse of current through a resistor to allow the generation of a heat pulse . the thin film resistor heats up with sufficient energy to cause skin rejuvenation and induced a biological response improving the appearance of the skin . typical energy delivery time duration is less than about 3 sec . optical and thermo - optical energy are responsible for tissue targeting although chemical processes ( such as pdt ) as well as optical or thermal induced mechanical processes . optical , thermal , chemical or mechanical responses in the tissue induced by a flash lamps or thermal energy generator together with a protruding guards that allow activation only in tissue safe areas a biological response that enhances skin appearance . the total heat energy transferred is low enough to prevent burns , typically less than 50 j / cm 2 and for most applications less than 10 j / cm 2 . for consumer applications an energy density of less than 2 j / cm 2 is contemplated and preferably less than 1 j / cm 2 . in another embodiment , of the present invention an electrical energy source is used to generate thermal pulses of energy . in yet another embodiment an optical absorbing layer that is heated by flash lamps within the device is used to create thermal pulses . the flash lamps are fired by a short discharge , which produces broadband light . such light can be filtered to produce specific absorption and specific tissue effects such as photothermolysis . depending on the desired final temperature of the optical absorbing layer one or multiple flash lamps can be fired simultaneously to combine their light under a single reflectors directing the light into the target skin . alternatively , lamps can be fired in sequence to result in broader longer pulse duration of energy . again , thermal conduction transfers the heat to the skin and causes a biological response that enlarges pores to enhance product or medicine delivery , clears acne , induce rejuvenation of the skin , and produce new collagen . the total heat transferred is low enough to prevent burns , typically less than 50 j / cm 2 and for most applications less than 5 j / cm 2 . in this embodiment , the absorbing layer can be designed to allow some light to be transmitted . for example , blue or uv light could be transmitted to interact directly with tissue and kill bacteria directly . one object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for treating acne as well as inserting and removing material from the skin . to accomplish this the invention contemplates in a preferred embodiment heating up the top layer of the skin so it expends . the expansion of the skin or a portion thereof , ( for example the top layers of the skin such as the epidermis , epidermis and dermis and epidermis and a portion of the dermis ) causes a relative displacement of every point on the skin with respect to an adjacent point . such an expansion , similar to the expansion of a balloon or the theory of the expanding universe , results in enlargement of pores and breakup of intercellular , and interlocking substance plugging pores or opening on the skin , and in increased skin porosity . note that unlike prior art that used to heat up the skin for the purpose of ablation , or natural occurring heating of the skin through hot baths or hot compresses , sunlight or space heaters , the heating of the skin contemplated by the present invention is design for the purpose of achieving sufficient heating of the top layers of the skin so that its expansion result in pore opening and increase skin porosity but not in damage to underlying viable tissue or irreversible damage to the skin or ablation or removal of skin components . expanding universe model ( eum ) for treatment of skin conditions and acne : fig1 a illustrates such an expansion of the skin ; the increased of distance between each and every adjacent point on the skin surface and the resulting opening of pores and other surface skin structures . in the figure , a preferred embodiment of the desired effect contemplated by the invention is described and the way to achieve this effect is also described in the following preferred embodiment . in fig1 a , 1 a 1 and 1 a 11 are schematic representation of the dermis and epidermis respectively . the locations on the surface of the epidermis , locations 1 a 17 , 1 a 12 , and 1 a 15 are separated , for example by , for example , 5 mm on the surface of the epidermis . if for example rapid heating of the skin is achieved by , for example , an electric , electromagnetic , light , or microwave heating of the skin , the skin will expand rapidly , like a balloon to the dimensions shown in the left side of the arrow , dimensions shown in 1 a 10 and 1 a 110 , for the dermis and epidermis respectively . the spots 1 a 17 , 1 a 12 , and 1 a 15 will now be further apart , for example , separated by a linear distance of , for example , 10 mm . the new locations are represented by 1 a 170 , 1 a 120 , and 1 a 150 . clearly , if the locations 1 a 17 , and 1 a 12 for example represent the initial position of two opposite ends of the pores , the new locations 1 a 120 and 1 a 170 represent an expanded pore whose diameter is now about twice as large and thus its surface opening is 4 times as large . note that to relieve liquid pressure due to sebum build up even a few microns of increased pore opening diameter will suffice . similarly , an increased in the pore opening diameter of only a few microns is sufficient to allow the enhanced penetration of liquid or fluids into the epidermis in to even to the dermis . the object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for treating hair and various skin conditions and ailments . for example , the device may be used for hair removal or reduction of hair follicle counts , treatment of psoriasis , acne , ( active acne , pimples , or scars ) reduction of wrinkles , fine lines , skin lesions , and / or general improvement in the appearance of the skin . another object of the present invention is to provide a device that can be used safely to treat a tissue without undesirable injuries to the skin . one of the features of the present invention is a mechanism to ensure that only healthy and indented tissue targets are treated . for example , both in the professional office ( physicians , dermatologists , plastic surgeon , aesthetician , hair dressers , cosmetologists , nurses , ob : gyn ) and for consumer use , there is an important need to ensure that no light or other form of energy would be applied to sensitive targets such as the eyes , or tissue and skin sites that are sensitive or injured . the present invention provide for such a mechanism . by utilizing a protruding guards or protruding arms that control the activation of the energy source , the protruding arms can prevent firing of the energy source unless they are ( all or part of them ) physically depressed to a certain level . the idea is that a sensitive target like the eye or the surface of the eye will not support that kind of mechanical pressure by the protruding guards ( pg ). furthermore , the eyelids instinctively shut or close when in contact , or even when approached by a mechanical object . such pg can be made of transparent material to minimize light energy source in the case of light energy use ( lasers , ipl , flash lamps , leds , or other light sources ) such pg can be made of cooled components or cooling parts to also serve to protect the epidermis from injury . for example they can be made of peltier cooler / thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) so that they can cool the surface of the skin as they make contact . the polarity of the peltier coolants can be quickly reversed so that these pg can be used alone or in combination with light or lasers , or rf or microwave sources , to heat and treat the surface of the skin or tissue . in a preferred embodiment the energy from the device is not able to be applied unless and until the pg are depressed to a predetermined level . the requirement of depressing the pgs is important for at least two reasons : the eye or sensitive or injured area of the skin or tissue , will not tolerate the contact and thus no activation of the energy source is possible and no injury will result the contact and depression of the pg require the output window to be spatially in close physical proximity to the skin or tissue surface or whatever the target is . this , in the case of light , lasers or any other em energy or thermal energy or radiative energy source , means that the energy is not spread over a large surface area but is directed and intercepted quickly with the intended target surface . in fig1 a hand held home use hair treatment device generally includes a flash lamp 100 is powered by a battery 110 or a power plug 120 which charges a capacitor 130 . the lamp 100 is willfully triggered and controlled through the use of a control board 140 and an activator switch 150 . the lamp 100 ( or any other energy source ) is housed in the consol 10 and its operation is also controlled by plurality of guards 30 . the protruding guards are protruding out of side of the device 10 facing the skin or the human body . the guards 30 are connected to the controller of the lamps and do not allow the lamp to fire unless they are all depressed to at least a predetermined depth . for example the predetermined depth can be such that the lamp is in close enough proximity to the target tissue or skin so that most of the light from the lamp 100 can not escape sideways and is only directed forward towards the skin . the energy source 100 can be laser or light source , flash lamps , led , rf , microwave , any kind of electromagnetic ( em ) energy source , any kind of radiative em , energy source , thermal energy source , or thermal cooling source ( negative or out of the target area flow of energy ) energy source . only when all protruding guards 30 are full depressed can the flash lamp fire . this arrangement prevents accidental firing of the lamp into the eye . the protruding guards 30 can be made of transparent material such as , for example , plastic or glass . the idea is that a protruding guards ( pi ) array 30 will ensure that the eye is closed prior and before firing of the lamp . fig2 shows the same device as in fig1 except that the protruding guards ( pg ) 30 are made of transparent material to minimize intercept of energy . by making the protruding guard 30 from transparent material , the energy from the source can travel with minimal interruption , minimal scattering and minimal absorption down the path towards the skin or target material . the pg 30 may also be made of substance capable of cooling the surface with which it is in contact so allow protection of the epidermis , further energy control , energy removal from the target tissue or surface being treated . the pg 30 may also be made of both transparent substance which is also capable of cooling the surface with which it is in contact so allow protection of the epidermis , further energy control , energy removal from the target tissue or surface being treated fig3 shows the same apparatus as in fig1 except that instead of a plurality of protruding guards pg only one is being used , 30 . the protruding guard can have all kind of desired properties : it may be made of cooling ( active or passive cooling ) so as it is pressed against the skin it also cools . it may be made of transparent material to allow more energy to get into the skin . it may be made of substance or mechanism capable of heating or energizing the skin or delivery energy into the skin . it may be made of absorbing material so that as it is being pressed against the skin it also absorbs energy generated by a light or lasers or any other em radiative energy source to absorb the energy and conduct it further into the treated surface or targeted surface . a predetermined \u201c press level \u201d i . e . the amount of physical depression in of the protruding guards pg in the direction of the arrow , can be determined and built into the device . fig3 also shows such a pre - determined depression of the pg , 301 , before they allow activation of the device . such a displacement in the pg extension out of the treatment head surface 305 can be built into the device to prevent firing before the device is brought to such predetermined proximity to the surface of the target area . the pg can also have a maximum \u201c collapse distance \u201d or press - distance where the pg can then prevent a contact closer than the predetermined level . the above descriptions and illustrations are only by way of example and are not to be taken as limiting the invention in any manner . one skilled in the art can substitute known equivalents for the structures and means described . the full scope and definition of the invention , therefore , is set forth in the appended claims . fig4 also shows the device contemplated by the present invention with the inclusion of a spring loading 309 to ensure that the protruding guards ( pg ) return to their un - depressed position once the device is removed from contact with the skin . it also shows the skin 312 in beginning to make contact with the pg in its initial extended position . specification and further preferred embodiments of various components of device with pg in further embodiment the invention contemplates a device for reducing the presence of hair

s description and composition are well known in the art . the condom 10 is shown in the \u201c rolled - up \u201d condition looking down from above in fig1 . in the compact or rolled - up condition , the material that forms the body of the condom is collected in a circumferential ring 12 , leaving an exposed top portion 14 . as can be seen in fig2 , a reservoir tip 29 is located on the distal end of the condom 10 . in the condom 10 of the present invention , a separate , self - contained , u - shaped packet 20 is affixed to the top portion 14 of the condom 10 . the u - shaped packet 20 may be affixed by a biocompatible adhesive , heat melt , or other suitable mechanical attachment method , or pre manufactured as a multi - part \u2018 to be assembled \u2019 condom set , or as a single compartmentalized condom , that will ensure that the packet 20 will remain affixed to the condom 10 throughout the act . the packet 20 may be sold separately from the condom 10 to be attached to the users condom of choice , or it may be sold as a condom with packet , multi - part set , or as pre manufactured compartmentalized single condom units . manufacturing issues of latex condoms may make it more desirable to have a two - piece arrangement that are assembled prior to use , where the packet 20 is placed over the condom 10 with a quick acting biocompatible adhesive just prior to intercourse . although the packet can take various shapes , the preferred shape is a u - shaped configuration that includes a semi - spherical upper surface and has an underside that includes a void to accommodate the condom &# 39 ; s reservoir tip . the lubricant containing packet can be prepared to release the contained fluid in various ways , although the most efficient is simply pricking the upper surface with a needle or pin 32 . other means for releasing the lubricant include a small tab 25 that seals the upper surface of the packet 20 . the tab 25 can be pulled back prior to penetration , revealing a small hole 30 that allows lubricant inside the packet 20 to slowly leak out as the penis penetrates the body lumen . the hole 30 formed when the tab 25 is pulled back is correctly sized , so that the lubricant will be emitted slowly and continuously over the course of the act of intercourse , providing continuing lubrication during the act . further , the lubrication will be dispensed inside the body cavity as opposed to outside the cavity , where it can be sheared off during penetration . in this manner , the condom 10 of the present invention lubricates the body lumen in a manner similar to the body &# 39 ; s own lubrication system . additionally , when the packet is pierced , a tiny amount of lubricant can begin to leak out providing lubricant at the entrance of the body lumen upon penetration , and continue to release lubricant well within the body lumen , as described . an ordinary pin 32 ( see fig3 ) or a pin type object can be enclosed with the product , and can be used to prick the packet 20 to create a small seepage hole 30 a through which the lubricant can leak out , or the packet 20 can have one or more small pin holes that are covered by a small piece of tape or removable cover ( not shown ). the packet 20 may be sold as a separate item that is placed on the condom of the user &# 39 ; s choice , either before unfurling the condom or after the condom is placed on the penis . in this example , the packet 20 will include a multipurpose adhesive that can reliably affix to latex , lubricated , non - lubricated , natural materials such as sheep skin or the like . the adhesive should be safe and bio - compatible so as not to cause irritation or damage to the involved tissues . a vegetable gum might be an example of a safe biocompatible adhesive . moreover , the packet 20 can be filled with various lubricants that are known in the art . as shown in fig4 , the packet 20 creates a void as it emits the lubricant until the packet 20 is depleted . typically condoms include a reservoir tip 29 to collect semen that is ejaculated . the condom &# 39 ; s reservoir tip in the present invention can thus replace the void created by the empty packet once the lubricant is expelled therefrom . this exchange allows the condom 10 of the present invention to create virtually no more space than existing condoms while adding a unique and beneficial lubrication function . in this manner , the condom of the present invention is an advance in the art . the embodiments just described and depicted in the accompanying drawings are not intended to be limited , but rather exemplary of the modes and uses of the present invention . it is to be understood that various modifications and alternate uses are envisioned , and the present invention is intended to encompass all such modifications and alternate uses as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art ."}

ray of an arthritic hip joint . the pelvic bone ( 1 ) represents the superior portion of the hip joint , the femur ( 10 ) represents the inferior portion of the hip joint , and the femoral head ( 20 ) rotates in the acetabulum ( 25 ). fig2 depicts an example of a femoral component ( 27 ) with a collar ( 28 ). the femoral component is also known as a femoral stem or femoral prosthesis . the collar desirably prevents the femoral prosthesis from subsiding down the femoral canal because the collar rests of the calcar osteotomy ( femoral neck cut ) and prevents further translation of the femoral prosthesis once the collar contacts the femoral osteotomy . fig3 a and 3 b depicts ap and lateral radiographs of a typical hip replacement . the acetabular component ( 30 ) has been implanted into the acetabulum . the femoral component or stem ( 50 ) has been implanted down the femoral canal to the desired level . the prosthetic femoral head ( 40 ) has been attached to the femoral component ( 50 ) and articulates with the acetabular component ( 30 ). the femoral stem has a collar ( 60 ), which rest against the femoral calcar bone ( 70 ). fig4 a depicts an ap view of a femoral guide ( 80 ) that references a substantial portion of the proximal femoral bone , such as either the anterior or posterior femoral neck . the guide could be patient specific or generic . as part of a pre - operative plan , the surgeon could use non - invasive imaging data or other information to determine his intended surgical approach to the hip joint , and this intended approach would determine whether the femoral guide would reference predominately the anterior femoral neck or posterior femoral neck . in both situations , the femoral guide could reference a significant portion of the superior and inferior femoral neck and femoral head ( 20 ) as well . the femoral guide ( 80 ) could contain a drill sleeve ( 110 ) that would accept a drill bit ( 130 ) that could form an anterior to posterior ( ap ) hole ( 120 ) in the femoral bone at the intersection of the vertical femoral cut guide ( 90 ) and the calcar femoral cut guide ( 100 ). this ap hole ( 120 ) could later be used to ensure the femoral broach and prosthesis were implanted in the proper location . after the surgeon drilled this ap hole ( 120 ), they could likely leave the drill bit in the bone and then use the vertical cut guide ( 90 ) and the calcar cut guide ( 100 ) in the femoral guide to make the appropriate osteotomy in the femoral bone . the drill bit could ensure that the saw blade did not extend beyond the intended osteotomy site , which could help prevent greater trochanter fractures from the saw blade extended beyond the intended osteotomy . alternatively , the surgeon could drill the ap hole and then remove this femoral guide ( 80 ) and insert a different femoral guide ( not shown ) that had a cylinder that fit inside this ap hole and a saw guide that rested on the surface of the femoral bone to guide a saw blade to make the calcar and vertical cuts . this alternative approach could include features ( not shown ) to create an improved fixation of the saw guide to the bone to prevent the saw guide from moving while the saw cut the bone . this alternative approach could also drill a second hole in the femoral neck or head for the main purpose of provided the saw guide with additional stability . the femoral head ( 20 ) could then be removed from the femur . the femoral guide could include one or more patient specific soft tissue protectors ( such as those disclosed in u . s . utility patent application ser . no . 14 / 059 , 372 , filed on oct . 21 , 2013 , and u . s . provisional patent application no . 61 / 716 , 571 , filed on oct . 21 , 2012 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties ) along the intended path of the calcar osteotomy and superior femoral neck to desirably prevent the saw blade from inadvertently extended beyond the bone and cutting the hip capsule . the saw blade could be allowed to contact the patient specific soft tissue protector once the saw blade left the femoral bone , instead of the soft tissue surrounding the hip joint . fig5 a depicts a view of a femoral guide ( 80 ) superimposed on the radiograph . the femoral guide ( 80 ) is shown referencing a large portion of the anterior femoral neck . the ap drill sleeve ( 110 ) is shown extending away from and attached to the femoral guide ( 80 ). the height of the drill sleeve ( 110 ) could be patient specific such that the length of the drill bit ( 130 ) minus the height of the drill sleeve ( 110 ) would equal the width of the femoral neck . the drill bit ( 130 ) would therefore drill through the femoral neck and desirably stop immediately after the drill bit went through the opposite cortex when the head of the drill bit contacted the drill sleeve . the drill bit could be any diameter , but in various embodiments would likely be around 3 - 5 mm in diameter . fig5 b depicts a view of a proximal femur after the ap hole ( 120 ) has been drilled and the femoral guide removed . the purposed vertical femoral osteotomy or cut ( 90 ) and the calcar femoral osteotomy or cut ( 100 ) are shown with the marked line , but the cuts have not been performed yet . fig6 a and 6 b depict the femoral bone ( 10 ) after the femoral neck osteotomy has been performed and the femoral head removed . the anterior to posterior ( ap ) hole ( 120 ) is shown at the intersection of the calcar osteotomy ( 100 ) and the vertical osteotomy ( 90 ) ( see fig5 b ). this ap hole could be located anywhere along the calcar osteotomy and does not necessarily have to be located at the intersection . in this embodiment , this ap hole ( 120 ) will be utilized , at least in part , to ensure that the surgeon inserts the broach and femoral prosthesis in the correct anteversion , varus / valgus angle , and depth . because the femoral head and neck have been removed , the medial and superior portions of the ap hole have been removed and the ap hole can accept an anterior to posterior ( ap ) bar ( 140 ) of the broach or prosthesis as they are inserted down the femoral canal . the femoral neck osteotomy surface ( 121 ), and the femoral periosteal surface ( 122 ) and the femoral endosteal surface ( 123 ) are depicted at the level of the femoral neck osteotomy . fig7 a depicts an exemplary femoral broach ( 130 ) inserted into the femur ( 10 ) to prepare or machine the bone to accept the femoral prosthesis . if desired , the femoral broach could include an ap bar ( 140 ) that extended a few millimeters in the anterior and posterior direction away from the broach much like a collar . this ap bar is shown in a more lateral position than a traditional collar , but could be located anywhere along the osteotomy . this ap bar would desirably be a similar diameter as the ap hole ( 120 ) and the drill bit ( 130 ). the broach and / or prosthesis would desirably be in the appropriate position when the anterior and posterior portions of the ap bar ( 140 ) aligned with the anterior and posterior portions of the ap hole ( 120 ). if the surgeon tried to change the femoral anteversion , then the ap bar would desirably no longer key into the ap hole ( 120 ). if the surgeon inserted the broach in a varus position , then the ap bar ( 140 ) could be medially to the ap hole ( 120 ); the surgeon could realize this mistake and remove more bone from the lateral proximal femur to get the broach out of a varus position and into the correct position . the ap bar ( 140 ) on the broach could be removable or elevated on the broach handle so that smaller broaches could be impacted further down the femoral canal to prepare for the next larger broach size . broaches smaller than the intended prosthetic size can typically extended down into the femoral canal a few millimeters below the osteotomy level . the ap bar ( 140 ) could be temporarily removed to allow these small broaches to fully prepare the femoral canal . the ap bar could also be removed so that the surgeon could knowingly change the anteversion of the femoral broach ( and calculate the degree of change ) if the intra - operative information suggested a change was needed . fig7 b depicts the broach without an ap bar . in this alternative embodiment , the surgeon could also simply rely on a visual marker ( 145 ) on the broach , without any type of ap bar , to inform the surgeon about whether the implanted broach position corresponded with the intended broach position . this visual marker shown in fig7 b can be a hollow cylinder ( 145 ) in the anterior to posterior direction . when the hollow cylinder lined up with the ap hole ( 120 ), the surgeon would know the broach was in the correct position regarding the anteversion , varus / valgus , and depth . this hollow cylinder could be limited to just the cross sectional area of the broach so that the hollow cylinder would not interfere with the broach extending below the osteotomy level . the broach could therefore be impacted to its desired level based on the contact between the broach and the medullary canal and endosteal surface . the visual marker ( 145 ) would desirably not prevent or interfere with the broach reaching its appropriate and / or desired position . if desired , the hollow cylinder could accept a drill bit so the surgeon could prepare this ap hole for the final prosthesis if there was a difference between the first ap hole preparation and the hollow cylinder of the broach . this preparation might be necessary if the surgeon implanted the broach further down the canal than the pre - operative plan predicted or if the surgeon deliberately or accidentally changed the anteversion or varus / valgus position of the broach relative to the plan . the femoral broach could include various additional support features , including the use of a collar feature having vertical sides that desirably contact the periosteal bone ( 122 ) to ensure that the broach was implanted in the femoral bone in the correct anteversion . the surgeon could also insert a patient specific cap on the femoral neck osteotomy surface ( 121 ) that referenced the ap holes ( 120 ). this patient specific cap could narrow the width of the proximal femoral canal and help guide the broach into the correct anteversion . the broach could also have vertical markings along the anterior and posterior surface of the broach so the surgeon could align these markings with the ap hole ( 120 ) as the broach was inserted into the femoral canal to ensure the implanted femoral anteversion matched the planned femoral anteversion . fig8 a and 8 b depicts an exemplary femoral prosthesis ( 150 ) implanted into the femur ( 10 ) with an additional collar feature ( 160 & amp ; 180 ) extending over the femoral neck osteotomy ( 121 ) and contacting the periosteal surface ( 122 ) of the exterior surface of the femoral neck . the collar feature could be patient specific , modular , or just come in multiple sizes . if the collar feature was patient specific , then the shape and size of the collar could be based off the pre - operative scan and manufactured as a continuous part of the femoral prosthesis to intimately fit the proximal femur . if the collar feature was modular , the surgeon would make a determination during the surgery as to the correct shape and size of the collar based on how the broach fit the bone . the surgeon could then attach a modular collar with the appropriate size to femoral prosthesis before or after it was implanted into the femoral canal . lastly , the device manufacture could offer the implant with multiple different size collars ( i . e . small , medium and large ) and allow the surgeon to select the most appropriate sized collar during the surgery . the collar feature could have a flat horizontal portion ( 160 ) that could contact the femoral neck osteotomy ( 121 ) and vertical portions ( 180 ) that could contact the endosteal ( 123 ) and / or periosteal ( 122 ) surfaces of the femoral calcar and neck . the collar feature could extend over the neck osteotomy ( 121 ) and down the exterior ( 122 ) and interior surfaces ( 123 ) of the anterior and posterior femoral neck . the flat horizontal portion ( 160 ) of the collar feature could intimately contact the neck osteotomy . the axial force from vertical loading of the hip joint could be transmitted across the horizontal portion of the collar to the femoral osteotomy surface ( 121 ). the horizontal portion ( 160 ) could be the same shape as the cross sectional thickness of the proximal bone at the osteotomy to prevent soft tissue impingement from an oversized collar . the vertical portion ( 180 ) of the collar feature could intimately contact the periosteal surface ( 122 ) of the anterior and posterior femoral neck and calcar . the torsion force between the femoral prosthesis and the femoral bone primarily comes from the moment arm of the femoral head being loaded away from the axis of the femoral prosthesis . in various embodiments , this torsion force could be transmitted through the vertical portions of the collar feature to the periosteal and endosteal surfaces of the femoral neck . when torsion stress is applied between the femoral prosthesis and the femoral bone , a traditional prosthesis will typically push on just one side ( anterior or posterior ) of the endosteal bone . the various embodiments disclosed herein , including the various features described herein , provide an improved prosthesis with collar features that can push on the endosteal surface on one side ( i . e . anterior ) and the periosteal surface of the other side ( i . e . posterior ). this improved torsion stability could prevent implant loosening , intra - operative fracture , and postoperative fracture . fig8 c depicts the ap bar ( 170 ) on the femoral prosthesis keying into the ap hole ( 120 ) in the femoral bone to ensure that the femoral prosthesis ( 150 ) was in the correct anteversion , varus / valgus orientation and depth . the ap bar could be modular such that the femoral prosthesis could have a hole or similar attachment device in the prosthesis . the surgeon could select a length for the anterior and posterior portion of the ap bar based on how far the femoral broach was from the anterior and posterior periosteal surfaces of the proximal femur . the surgeon could then screw the 2 bars into the femoral prosthesis . in various alternative embodiments , the femoral prosthesis could just have a single hole so the 2 bars could be placed through the femoral prosthesis and screw into each other . the cross section of the bar and the hole in the femoral prosthesis could be round to allow for rotation , or could be provided in non - round ( i . e ., oval , triangular , square or other configurations \u2014 with corresponding unique spacing arrangements ) to prevent and / or inhibit unwanted rotation . the femoral prosthesis could include one or more collar features , one or more collar features in combinations with the ap bar ( fig8 a and 8 b ), or just the ap bar ( fig8 c ). the collar feature could be continuous and connected with the ap bar or could comprise a separate tab that was not connected to the ap bar . if the collar feature did not attach to the ap bar , the ap bar ( 170 ) could have a vertical wall ( 175 ) on each of the anterior and posterior end of the bar that would extend in the inferior direction and contact the periosteal ( 122 ) surface of the anterior and posterior femoral neck . the vertical wall of the collar feature could alternatively start at the anterior bar and extend medially around the calcar and then continue around to the posterior bar as shown in fig8 b . both the vertical and horizontal portions of the collar feature could be continuous around the entire femoral neck osteotomy or just small tabs in certain areas to allow better visualization of the contact between the collar and the femoral bone . traditional non - collared femoral prosthesis load the endosteal surface of the proximal femoral bone and create hoop stresses in the proximal femur when the femoral prosthesis is driven into the bone during implanting the prosthesis or weight bearing . a femoral prosthesis with a generic \u201c collar \u201d design loads the endosteal surface ( 123 ) of the proximal femoral bone and the osteotomy surface ( 121 ). the femoral prosthesis described here , in combination with the vertical portion of the collar feature , desirably allows the prosthesis to load the periosteal surface of the proximal femur as well as the endosteal surface and the osteotomy surface . loading the periosteal surface can help counteract and / or negate the hoop stresses that are generated from loading the endosteal bone . this periosteal loading would desirably generate compressive forces in the proximal femur instead of tensile forces ( hoop stresses ). the material properties of bone are much stronger in compression than tension , so loading the periosteal surface could decrease femoral calcar fractures . fig8 a also depicts two suture holes ( 190 ) in the anterior and posterior portion of the collar . these suture holes could vary in number and be used to reattach the posterior or anterior hip capsule back to the femoral bone . these suture holes could also be used to reattach the greater trochanter if a trochanter fracture occurred during the surgery . fig9 a , 9 b , and 9 c depict ap and lateral views of another exemplary collar feature on an exemplary femoral prosthesis . the horizontal portion ( 160 ) and vertical portion ( 180 ) of the collar feature are shown . the ap bar ( 170 ) is shown . fig9 b depicts the exterior vertical collar ( 200 ) that can be positioned to contact the periosteal surface ( 122 ) of the proximal femur and the interior vertical collar ( 210 ) that desirably contacts the endosteal surface ( 123 ) of the proximal femur . the vertical wall in fig9 b is desirably parallel with the axis of the prosthesis . fig9 c depicts an exterior vertical collar ( 215 ) that is divergent to the axis of the prosthesis , which desirably allows for easier insertion of the prosthesis over the femoral neck osteotomy . this divergent wall could also load the periosteum of the proximal femur and neglect the hoop stresses that are typically generated from the normal prosthesis loading of the endosteal surface of the proximal femur . this arrangement also reduces and / or negates the need for a cerclage wire or other reinforcing arrangement on the proximal femur , as surgeons will occasionally place a cerclage wire around the proximal femur to counteract the hoop stresses on the bone associated with implanting the prosthesis in much the same way as this divergent wall could . it should be understood that the collar features could be formed in a wide variety of shapes and / or configurations , including shapes and / or features that match and / or substantially conform , to varying degrees , to the underlying anatomy that they contact . for example , the collar features could comprise a hemispherical dome , an oval - shaped dome , a triangular box , a square or virtually any other shape that accomplished some or all of the features of the present invention . in various embodiments , the bone - contacting surface ( s ) of the collar feature may be non - round and / or irregularly curved and / or otherwise shaped , so as to desirably reduce , prevent and / or inhibit rotation of the implant and / or preferentially load the periosteal bone to varying degrees ( instead of the endosteal side of the bone ). it should also be understood that , where the collar feature and prosthesis are modular and / or separately formed , the collar feature could include a circular , non - circular and / or irregularly shaped opening formed therein to accommodate the femoral prosthesis . fig1 a , 10 b , and 10 c depict cross - sectional views of a standard flat calcar reamer ( 220 ), of a reverse domed - shaped calcar reamer ( 250 ), and of a hemispherical or domed shaped calcar reamer ( 260 ). flat calcar reamers are well known in the art . the male portion ( 230 ) of the femoral broach ( 70 ) slides into the female portion ( 240 ) of the flat calcar reamer . the flat calcar reamer can rotate around the male portion and remove the necessary femoral bone to make a flat osteotomy surface ( 121 ) that maximizes contact between a flat collar and the femoral bone . fig1 b depicts a cross - sectional view of a reverse domed - shaped reamer that could rotate around the male portion of the broach and desirably remove an amount of femoral bone to create a dome shaped osteotomy surface to maximize contact between a reverse dome shaped collar and the femoral bone . if desired , the curvature of the reamer ( i . e ., modifying the proximal femur ) could be slightly flatter than the curvature of the associated collar feature , which could facilitate the collar contacting the outside edge ( i . e ., periosteal edge ) of the bone and loading the bone from the \u201c outside - in .\u201d fig1 c depicts a cross - sectional view of a hemisphere shaped reamer ( 260 ) that could rotate around the male portion of the broach and remove the necessary femoral bone to create a reverse dome ( i . e ., a hemispherical dome ) shaped osteotomy surface that maximizes contact between a hemispherical shaped collar and the femoral bone . the advantage of a dome shaped or reverse dome shaped osteotomy surface can be that axial compression of the implant and bone will desirably increase the contact between the collar and the bone . the torsion stability of the implant could also be improved by this arrangement . the anterior to posterior and medial to lateral stability of the implant could also be improved . the reverse dome shaped osteotomy in fig1 b with the dome shaped collar could also help minimize hoop stress from the femoral component loading the femoral canal . the dome shaped collar could help transform the tensile forces ( i . e ., hoop stresses ) into compressive forces , and thereby help prevent calcar fractures that can be seen with implanting a standard femoral prosthesis or loading the femoral prosthesis during weight bearing movement . the vertical portion of the patient specific collar could also help minimize hoop stresses in a manner similar to the cerclage wire does when it is wrapped around the proximal femoral bone , but without the need for such an additional adjunct to the surgery . if desired , the transitional spacing between the horizontal and vertical exterior surfaces of the collar could be rounded to prevent soft tissue impingement . the drawings and text above refer to the implantation of a femoral component into a femoral bone for descriptive purposes only . similar principles such as those described above could apply to other joints like the knee , ankle , feet , shoulder , elbow , back and wrist , with various modifications to account for anatomical and loading differences . for example , the sutures holes ( 190 ) in the vertical portions of the collar , shown in fig8 , could be applied to an implant for the shoulder joint to allow for a repair of the rotator cuff tendons ( supraspinatus , subscapularis , and / or anterior capsule ). the entire disclosure of each of the publications , patent documents , and other references referred to herein is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual source were individually denoted as being incorporated by reference . the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof . the foregoing embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects illustrative rather than limiting on the invention described herein . scope of the invention is thus intended to include all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the descriptions provided herein . many of the aspects and advantages of the present invention may be more clearly understood and appreciated by reference to the accompanying drawings . the accompanying drawings are incorporated herein and form a part of the specification , illustrating embodiments of the present invention and together with the description , disclose the principles of the invention . although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding , it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure herein ."}
